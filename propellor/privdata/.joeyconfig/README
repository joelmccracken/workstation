This is the privdata used by propellor's author, Joey Hess.

While it has lots of important data in it, it's thankfully encrypted, so
you can't read it.

If you're bothered by this directory cluttering up your clone of propellor,
feel free to delete it. Just don't expect Joey to merge any branches that
delete it.
