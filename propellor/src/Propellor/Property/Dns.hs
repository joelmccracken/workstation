-- | Primary dns server for a domain, using bind.
--
-- Currently, this only configures bind to serve forward DNS, not reverse DNS.
--
-- Most of the content of the zone file is configured by setting properties
-- of hosts. For example,
--
-- > host "foo.example.com"
-- >   & ipv4 "192.168.1.1"
-- >   & alias "mail.exmaple.com"
--
-- Will cause that hostmame and its alias to appear in the zone file,
-- with the configured IP address.
--
-- Also, if a host has a ssh public key configured, a SSHFP record will
-- be automatically generated for it.
--
-- The [(BindDomain, Record)] list can be used for additional records
-- that cannot be configured elsewhere. This often includes NS records,
-- TXT records and perhaps CNAMEs pointing at hosts that propellor does
-- not control.
--
-- The primary server is configured to only allow zone transfers to
-- secondary dns servers. These are determined in two ways:
--
-- 1. By looking at the properties of other hosts, to find hosts that
-- are configured as the secondary dns server.
--
-- 2. By looking for NS Records in the passed list of records.
--
-- In either case, the secondary dns server Host should have an ipv4 and/or
-- ipv6 property defined.

-- | Primary dns server for a domain, secured with DNSSEC.
--
-- This is like `primary`, except the resulting zone
-- file is signed.
-- The Zone Signing Key (ZSK) and Key Signing Key (KSK)
-- used in signing it are taken from the PrivData.
--
-- As a side effect of signing the zone, a
-- </var/cache/bind/dsset-domain.>
-- file will be created. This file contains the DS records
-- which need to be communicated to your domain registrar
-- to make DNSSEC be used for your domain. Doing so is outside
-- the scope of propellor (currently). See for example the tutorial
-- <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server--2>
--
-- The 'Recurrance' controls how frequently the signature
-- should be regenerated, using a new random salt, to prevent
-- zone walking attacks. `Weekly Nothing` is a reasonable choice.
--
-- To transition from 'primary' to 'signedPrimary', you can revert
-- the 'primary' property, and add this property.
--
-- Note that DNSSEC zone files use a serial number based on the unix epoch.
-- This is different from the serial number used by 'primary', so if you
-- want to later disable DNSSEC you will need to adjust the serial number
-- passed to mkSOA to ensure it is larger.
