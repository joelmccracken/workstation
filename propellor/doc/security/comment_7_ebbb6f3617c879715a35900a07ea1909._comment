I wonder if there could be a shortcut in PrivData handling that hashes the input with crypt() instead of passing it raw to a machine. For instance passwords are stored in plain on the target machines, while this is not required to set the password in shadow: the hash would suffice. I think this page should at least spell out that fact.
