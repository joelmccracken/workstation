It is not clear to me whether or not it is safe to publish my own propellor repository to a publicly hosted service. It seems to me that when I do ./propellor --add-key MYKEYID, the private key data is stored in the repository as a commit, so pushing it exposes this data to the public. Am I wrong? 

Thanks
