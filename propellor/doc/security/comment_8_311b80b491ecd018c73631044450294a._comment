@Philipp, indeed: It's important to realize that all data entered into
the privdata with `propellor --set` is deployed in cleartext to the
machines that use it. Kept in a directory only root can read, but still,
important to bear in mind.

I've added the ability to use `CryptPassword` instead of `Password`
to `User.hasPassword` and `User.hasSomePassword`.
