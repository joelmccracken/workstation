OK, I manage to get my first propellor config run fine by setting different branch.master.url and branch.master.pushUrl configurations: 

* Use a https:// based url for the first 
* Use a git:// based url for the second

I had to nuke the remote /usr/local/propellor directory because it still had wrong configuration with a single remote url.
