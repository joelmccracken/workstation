 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * Localdir.hasOriginUrl: Depend on Git.installed.
   * Localdir.hasOriginUrl: Type changed from UnixLike to DebianLike
     because Git.installed is not implemented for other unixes.
     (API change)
   * Changed the ChrootBootstrapper type class's buildchroot method
     to take a Info parameter, instead of Maybe System.
     (The System can be extracted from the Info.)
     (API change)
 * [ Sean Whitton ]
   * Chroot.{de,}bootstrapped uses the chroot's configured apt proxy and
     mirror, if these exist, when debootstrapping the chroot.
