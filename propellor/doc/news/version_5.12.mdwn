   * Worked around a situation where ghc uses insane amounts of memory
     displaying an error message about a property of a host having the
     wrong number of arguments.
   * Added libghc-type-errors-dev to debian/control recommends, and
     install it if available when bootstrapping propellor.
   * Borg: add UseUmask to BorgRepoOpt.
     Thanks, Nicolas Schodet
   * Borg: use "{now}" instead of $(date ...)
     Thanks, Nicolas Schodet
   * Makefile: Deal with cabal change that made sdist
     not output tarball to stdout.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton"""]]
