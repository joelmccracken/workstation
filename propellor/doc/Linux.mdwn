Propellor was written to manage Linux systems.
It supports Debian and Debian-derived distributions,
as well as Arch Linux.

Support for other distributions should not be too hard to add.
Indeed, Propellor has been ported to [[FreeBSD]] now!
See [[forum/Supported_OS]] for porting tips.

Note that you can run Propellor on a OSX laptop and have it manage Linux
and other systems.
