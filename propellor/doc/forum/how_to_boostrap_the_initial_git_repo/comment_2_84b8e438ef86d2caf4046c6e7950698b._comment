I don't know what deploy branch trick you're referring to using.

There is the deploy remote, which I think should do what you want:

When you have a deploy remote configured in your local repository,
the first time you spin a new host, it will clone its /usr/local/propellor
from the url of the deploy remote. On subsequent spins, it sends the
url over, and the host's repository's url is updated too.

The PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl property doesn't take effect until
propellor runs with that configuration, which could be a bit of a chicken and
egg situation. Except hmm, spin could look for that property and use
repo url instead of the deploy remote's url. Yeah, I've done that now!
