I tried adding:

      & bootstrapWith (Robustly Stack)

But that fails trying to install stack:

    Fetched 413 kB in 7s (54.3 kB/s)                           
    Reading package lists...                                   
    E: Unable to locate package haskell-stack                  
    sh: 1: stack: not found                                    
    sh: 1: stack: not found                                    

That's not really too surprising, of course, since this package isn't in jessie (or stretch, for that matter).
