Okay, got it to work:

1. Installed haskell-stack by hand from unstable (the package works fine even on jessie).
2. Removed the \"dist\" directory in the remote /usr/local/propellor.

After that the build was successful; I think that points to the original failure being due to the ancient GHC in jessie, but I'm not 100% sure.
