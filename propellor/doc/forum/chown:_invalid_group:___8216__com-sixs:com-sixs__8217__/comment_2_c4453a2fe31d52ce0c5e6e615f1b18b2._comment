Make that into a git patch and I will merge it.

However.. If you `git grep userGroup` you will find all the other places
that propellor assumes a user-group system. Seems it would be worth fixing
those too, especially the other ones in Ssh.

Seems like another approach to it could be to make
`userGroup`'s behavior configurable based on another Property
of the Host that sets Info containing say, a function from `User -> Group`.
Looks to me that would be doable, if a little bit annoying since userGroup
would need to change from a pure function to a Propellor action in order to
use `askInfo`.
