Thinking more about a hypothetical property like
`userGroupFunction (\User u -> Group (u ++ "-group"))`
the idea seems problimatic because all the properties that install a
package with a dedicated user and group would seem to need to be changed
to support putting the user in the group configured by the property.

I suppose it could be documented to be limited to non-system users and
groups, so only User.accountFor would need to support when making users and
groups, and Ssh.userKeyAt etc would use it to tell what group to use for a
non-system user. 

Although, is Ssh.userKeyAt etc really limited to being
used with non-system users? Perhaps User should have an additional
SystemUser constructor to encode the distinction. Or perhaps this idea of
mine is going in the wrong direction.
