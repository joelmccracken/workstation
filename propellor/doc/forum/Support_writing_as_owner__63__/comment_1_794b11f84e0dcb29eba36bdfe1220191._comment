If propellor could fork and then setuid, that would allow this. But..

* forking is problimatic in haskell since the RTS state gets shared
  and bad things happen
* the result of the setuid action would need to be communicated back to the
  main process somehow

The other way would be to re-exec propellor as the user 
with a parameter that somehow tells it what action to run. But I don't know
a general way to do that, without some way to name the property.
(A problem which has also complicated some other parts of propellor eg
running inside chroots.)
