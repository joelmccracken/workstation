It depends. If it makes sense for your property to remove the software
when it's reverted, then make `installed` revertable like that.

Maybe that doesn't make sense though, you only want to make sure it's
installed before using it, but you don't necessarily want to remove it just
because this one property that uses it gets reverted. You can express that
this way:

	((setup `requires` installed) <!> cleanup)

I do think it was a good change, in propellor 2.13.0, to make "revertable
`requires` nonrevertable" not be a RevertableProperty. Now when we want a
RevertableProperty, we have to think about whether it makes sense to revert
the whole thing or not; before this change we just got back a so-called
RevertableProperty that was not actually fully revertable, and probably
didn't think about it enough.
