Yes, I also found it kind of annoying to need to move /usr/local/propellor
out of the way when I was working on secret-project. This is why I'd like
it to be usable without propellor --spin so that directory would not be
used, but until the bug with that can be fixed, you can't work on
secret-project with an unrelated other propellor config at the same time.
