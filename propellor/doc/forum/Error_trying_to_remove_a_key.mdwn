I try to remove a key from my propellor repository, but it fails:

    % propellor --rm-key 41EED9A677C20D87
    gpg: there is a secret key for public key "41EED9A677C20D87"!
    gpg: use option "--delete-secret-keys" to delete it first.
    removing key from propellor's keyring ... failed

I believe gpg gets access to my secret keys using the agent now, it no longer use direct access.
