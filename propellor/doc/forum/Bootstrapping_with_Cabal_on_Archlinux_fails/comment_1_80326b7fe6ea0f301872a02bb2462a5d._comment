I haven't yet prepared a patch for this, but in src/Propellor/Bootstrap.hs, the `archlinuxdeps Cabal` list of should have `\"haskell-type-errors\"` added to it. That's the name of the Archlinux package for [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-errors](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-errors). Without that package, Cabal has to download type-errors and its dependencies before building Propellor, but with that package added, Archlinux's package manager can manage that package (and keep it up-to-date) instead.

With that one change, the `archlinuxdeps Cabal` list is complete (at least as of yesterday when I tested it).

I'll prepare a patch for this and submit it to propellor@joeyh.name soon.
