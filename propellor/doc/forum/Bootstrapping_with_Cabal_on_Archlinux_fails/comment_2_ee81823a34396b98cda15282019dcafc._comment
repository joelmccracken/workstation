Seems odd that the way Arch has installed ghc would
make `cabal install` fail without additional options being added very time.
That does not strike me as a good decision if it's the case. I guess that
the -dynamic should only be set on Arch, since only it has inflicted this
problem on itself.

Would appreciate a patch with the ghc 8.8 fixes.

I would not be surprised if cabal new-build does not provide any good way
to find out where the executable was put, because after all cabal build
doesn't either (just it's easier to guess there). Cabal expects a workflow
where that's followed by cabal install, or cabal run.

This might be one way: `cabal new-install --symlink-bindir=.`  
But with my older version of cabal, that seems to not actually work,
indeed I can't get it to install the binaries anywhere. Maybe it does
work with the newer cabal where new-install is the default.

Needing to detect whether new-build was used or not is an added
complication.

Best way I've found:

	find dist-newstyle/ -executable -type f |grep 'propellor$'
