I'm curious why you needed to make clean. AFAIK the new cabal will ignore
any cruft left by the old version and should just do a from scratch build
on its own.

Indeed, one of my hosts managed by propellor has both
/usr/local/propellor/dist and dist-newstyle, and is building successfully
in the latter directory.
