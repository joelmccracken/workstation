Hello, sorry to bother you once again :)

I would like to use propellor in order to prepare a bunch of schroot for sbuild.
This way all my machines could be used to prepare packages.

so I tryed to created a Debootstrap property in order to generate the initial image

    & Chroot.debootstrapped (System (Debian (Stable "jessie")) "i386") Debootstrap.BuilddD "/var/lib/sbuild/jessie-i386.tar.gz"

But this does not work.

So I would like to know what should be done in order to instanciante a sbuild schroot and also how to customize it in order to add the apt proxy informations.
