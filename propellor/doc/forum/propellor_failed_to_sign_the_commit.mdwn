Hello since sometime on my computer gpgv1 -> gpgv2 transition on Debian 

I get this error message. (I need to say that I am using a NitroKey Pro for my gpg keys)
 
    Propellor build ... done
    error: gpg n'a pas pu signer les données
    fatal: échec de l'écriture de l'objet commit
    Git commit ... failed

reading this bug report

Ifound that I need to define


    https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Common-Problems.html

    The gpg-agent man page nowadays includes the following hint:

      It is important to set the GPG_TTY environment variable in your login
      shell, for example in the ‘~/.bashrc’ init script:

      export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

don't you think that propellor should define GPG_TTY in order to avoid this problem ?

thanks

Frederic
