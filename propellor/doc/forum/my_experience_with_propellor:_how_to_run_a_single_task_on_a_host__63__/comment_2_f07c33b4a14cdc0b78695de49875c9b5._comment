using the command line: well yes, that's right.
Still: I can configure a lot of details in haskell (ansible playbooks):

my emacs task eg. is not only ensuring that emacs is installed
(as in the example above), but I also set some links to my
elisp config files, ensure that cask installed etc.

another task for me is installing X windows:
again lots of details: not only the xorg packages,
but some links to .xsession files, window manager config
files etc.

and yes: I am happy, that I can spell out the details
of these tasks in propellor/haskell.

I just don't see the point of ensuring them again and again
with every spin of propellor, and I would want
to be able to run just this one task on the command line.


concerning 
```
  Apt.update `period` Daily
```
thanks, will have a look.
but I guess this is cron job (will see),
in general I think I will want to stick to my habit, that I want
to see what's going on (what is upgraded), thus prefer
to not run any cron jobs for apt upgrades

My overall message / concern is: I don't want to completly change my
habits, just because I am using propellor

I had the habit of installing my computers task by task

I had the habit of logging in to one of my systems, and 
doing apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

I want my config tool to help me achieve things in my
way that I am used to.
