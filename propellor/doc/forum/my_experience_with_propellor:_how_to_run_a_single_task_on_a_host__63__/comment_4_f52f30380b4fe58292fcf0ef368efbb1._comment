Well thanks a lot, and yes I am learning: propellor has a lot
of powerful features under the hood already.

I still remain sceptical for the time being:

Propellor's overall approach seems: one spin of propellor does ensure
that a complete systems is properly installed (and then one can
declare exceptions: don't check this every time...). I can even see
how this is useful: if I where a sys admin with a huge farm of
systems, I wouldn't want to deal with half installed systems, but just
have propellor do a complete job.

As far as I am only concerned with a few personal computers of mine, I
prefer to stick to my task by task approach, though, and for tasks
that come up reapeatedly (like keeping my apt cache + installed
packages up to date) that seems reasonable to me as well. - having
only a minimal required configuration for a host, and then building
upon that (I think/hope, you got the idea by now). The fact, that
this model is nicely supported by ansible, seems to suggest at least,
that this kind of reasoning/approach is not completely flawed.

What is not 100% clear to me: if propellor could be bent to support my
kind of workflow: I would think that it's possible? (even though I
might not have the time to bend it that way myself). Or are there any
fundamental issues with it?

What I am suggesting is: that propellor be at my disposal,
more as a library, and would not also impose a certain
command line interface / workflow on me.

Anyway, you would certainly win me as a user (don't know
how much that counts, and cannot speak for other people's
needs).

Thanks anyway.
  Andreas
