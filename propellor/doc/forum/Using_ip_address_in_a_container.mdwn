Hello,

I would like to create a systemd container using the --network-bridge option
to systemd-nspawn and fixed addresses.

Previously I used lxc containers but I'm afraid adding lxc support is quite a
large task.

My previous setup includes:

- static ip addresses per container (set using LXC, but
  /etc/network/interface will do),
- different hostname for each of the containers,
- configuration of a bind zone for my local container network,
- configuration of the firewall using ferm,
- proxy from host to containers using nginx.

If I understand correctly, alias or ipv4 are propagated to the host and are
not part of the container definition, is that right?

I am also not sure about the setting of the hostname.

Do you have some hints about how this could be done?
