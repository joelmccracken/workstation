Hi,

The secret-project README says to do `stack build`.

Doing that gives me a clean compile.


But what deliverable should I have now?


Snippet from `secret-project.cabal`:

    Executable propellor-config
      Main-Is: config.hs

But I don't have a `propellor-config`.

Running `propellor` gives compile errors.
So that doesn't seem the next step for getting any deliverable.

For what should I be looking??


Cheers
