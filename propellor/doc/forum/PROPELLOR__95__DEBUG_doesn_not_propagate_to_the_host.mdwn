While investigating my rm property problem I ran propellor with

    PROPELLOR_DEBUG=1 propellor

At the beginning I have the debug informations but not once the ssh connection was initiated on the host.

So I had to log into the host in order to run locally propellor in debug mode.

It seems to me that the PROPELLOR_DEBUG=1 env should be propagate to the host, chroot etc...
