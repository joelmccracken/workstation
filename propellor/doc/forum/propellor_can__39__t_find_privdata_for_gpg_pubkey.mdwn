I have the following property for one of my hosts:

[[!format haskell """
 File.hasPrivContent "/usr/share/debug-me/keyring/a_CS2613_prof.gpg"  anyContext
"""]]

Unsurprisingly, the first time I run `propellor --spin my-host` I get

[[!format text """
** warning: Missing privdata PrivFile "/usr/share/debug-me/keyring/a_CS2613_prof.gpg" (for any)
Fix this by running:
  propellor --set 'PrivFile "/usr/share/debug-me/keyring/a_CS2613_prof.gpg"' 'any' \
    < /usr/share/debug-me/keyring/a_CS2613_prof.gpg
"""]]

I cut and paste the suggested lines (after previously copying the file into place manually, but it doesn't seem to change anything. On subsequent runs I get the same thing.

if I run `propellor --dump  'PrivFile "/usr/share/debug-me/keyring/a_CS2613_prof.gpg"' 'any' | gpg` I get
[[!format text """

I understand that the propellor run is using a different copy of privdata, but I verified the checksums match between my user propellor install and the one in /usr/local/propellor.

Other uses of `privFileContent` with anyContext work fine on the same host.
