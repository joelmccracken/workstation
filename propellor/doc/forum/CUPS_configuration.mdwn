Any ideas for good ways to manage CUPS config?  /etc/cups/printers.conf starts with `# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WHEN CUPSD IS RUNNING`. I can do the obvious stop / replace / restart, but am curious if anyone has any success stories or pitfalls to relate.

A very quick search suggests using "lpadmin" is the approved way of updating CUPS config. So I guess I can run some Cmd.cmpProperty calls
