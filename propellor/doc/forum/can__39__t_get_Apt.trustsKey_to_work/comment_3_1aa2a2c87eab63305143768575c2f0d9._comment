@david, you might need to edit your config.cabal and specify a newer
propellor version, although cabal usually picks the most recent version of
a dependency. Propellor got the patch from this page in version 5.3.4.

Anyway, I don't think the version of propellor matters, the error message
you quote is related to
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=844724>.
I think that the apt key you're using has been generated on a newer system
and won't work with older gpg.
