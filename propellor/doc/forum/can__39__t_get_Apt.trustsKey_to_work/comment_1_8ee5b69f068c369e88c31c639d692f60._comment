I added trustsKey in 2014, but my current config is not using
it for anything, so it seems likely it's bitrotted in some way.
And there's no rationalle documented for why it manually drives gpg.

I've applied your change to use apt-key.

I wonder if the nukeFile of the "gpg dropping" is actually needed
anymore?
