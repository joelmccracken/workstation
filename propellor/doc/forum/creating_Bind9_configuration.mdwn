I try to use propellor to deploy a secondary DNS server.

In your configuration, I see nothing to change the `listen-on { 127.0.0.1; };` option, did I miss something?

Also, in `Dns.secondaryFor`, I do not know how to set `confLines` to something else, should I use this function and peel the result until I can change this or shoud I add a `Dns.secondaryFor'` version with an extra argument?

By the way, is it really advisable to use a "minimal config" instead of a full clone?

Thanks!
