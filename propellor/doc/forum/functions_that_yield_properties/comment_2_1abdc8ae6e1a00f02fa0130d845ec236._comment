Another, simpler approach that I often use in my config.hs:

	foo :: Host
	foo = host "foo.example.com" $ props
		& User.accountFor myacc
		& Sudo.enabledFor myacc
	  where
		myacc = "joey"

You can also bundle up a bunch of properties that
each need a User into a single combined
`User -> Property DebianLike`

	myAccountIs :: User -> Property DebianLike
	myAccountIs u = propertyList ("my user is " ++ u) $ props
		& User.accountFor u
		& Sudo.enabledFor u
