You can use `ensureProperty` to do this.

	withMyAcc desc mkp = property' desc $ \w ->
		u <- getMyAcc
		ensureProperty w (mkp u)

The type of this will be somewhat more complex than the one you gave,
but it should work.

Alas a description has to be provided to withMyAcc. It cannot reuse the
description of `mkp` because to get a property that it can introspect for its
description, a User has to be provided, and the User can only be determined by
running Propellor (IO) action getMyAcc. You might be able to finesse this
by using a monoidial value and get the description of `mkp mempty`.

Or, you could do something like this to tie the knot. I don't know if this
is a good idea (it might even `<<loop>>`), but it illustrates the core
problem nicely; to get at the Info, we need a Host, but to get a Host, we
need to already know its properties.

	foo :: Host
	foo = host "foo.example.com" $ props
		& withMyAcc (hostInfo foo) User.accountFor
