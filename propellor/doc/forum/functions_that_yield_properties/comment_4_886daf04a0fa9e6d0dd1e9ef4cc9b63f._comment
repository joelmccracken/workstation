`Maybe a` is a Monoid, so something along that line was what I was
thinking.

----

	withMyAcc
		:: (SingI outer, Cannot_ensureProperty_WithInfo inner ~ 'True,
		    NotSuperset (Targets inner) (Targets outer) ~ 'CanCombine)
		=> Desc
		-> (User -> Property (MetaTypes inner))
		-> Property (MetaTypes outer)

The complicated constraints there are inherited from the use of `ensureProperty`.

A less general form of that is:

	withMyAcc :: Desc -> (User -> Property DebianLike) -> Property DebianLike
