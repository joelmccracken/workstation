Hello, I just installed propellor 2.13.0 and  now I get this error message.

It was sort of expected due to the chnages in the API.
I would like your advice about this problem.
Indeed I combine Property and RevertableProperty.

so what should be the best way to fix this issue.

    src/Propellor/Property/Sbuild.hs:57:51:
    Couldn't match type ‘Property (CInfo HasInfo NoInfo)’
                  with ‘RevertableProperty HasInfo’
    Expected type: RevertableProperty HasInfo
      Actual type: CombinedType
                     (RevertableProperty HasInfo) (Property NoInfo)
    In the expression: (setup <!> cleanup) `requires` installed
    In an equation for ‘schroot’:
        schroot sn chroot@(Chroot.Chroot chrootdir _ _)
          = (setup <!> cleanup) `requires` installed
          where
              setup
                = conf `requires` (provision `onChange` targz)
                where
                    provision
                      = toProp (Chroot.provisioned chroot) `before` umount
                      where
                          ...
                    targz = createTarball chrootdir tarball
                    ....
              cleanup
                = File.notPresent (schrootChrootD </> sn)
                  `requires` File.notPresent tarball
                  `requires` toProp (revert (Chroot.provisioned chroot))
              tarball = chrootdir <.> "tar.gz"


thanks
