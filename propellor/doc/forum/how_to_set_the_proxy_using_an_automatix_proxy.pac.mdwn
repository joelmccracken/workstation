Hello,

I am trying propellor on Debian Jessie (haskell is fantastic for this sort or things) to setup one of my computer.

On my network, the system administrator set proxies for http and https.
These information are available via a http://proxy/proxy.pac URL.

So I would like to know what should be done to extract this information and set it for all users on the system ?

Cheers

Frederic
