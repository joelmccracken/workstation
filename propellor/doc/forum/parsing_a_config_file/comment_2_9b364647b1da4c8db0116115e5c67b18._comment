Sean and I have implemented a somewhat generic support for files with some
kinds of sections, in Propellor.Property.ConfFile. 

I think it could be used for this tor case, by making the SectionStart
match the HiddenServiceDir line, and the SectionPast match any line that's
not HiddenServicePort (or perhaps match the next HiddenServiceDir
line?)
