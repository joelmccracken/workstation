More accurately, it's Gpg.keyImported that's failing, and this is because
it's implemented using a flagFile to remember if it's imported the gpg key
before. So the fix would be to implement:

	hasPrivKey :: GpgKeyId -> User -> IO Bool

	hasPubKey :: GpgKeyId -> User -> IO Bool

And then Gpg.keyImported could use those with `check` to avoid redundant
import.
