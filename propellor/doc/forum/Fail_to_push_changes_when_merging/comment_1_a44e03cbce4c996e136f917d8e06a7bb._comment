It looks like git is failing because it can't autodetect an e-mail address for root on the target machine.  This might be because the target machine does not have a FQDN, but I'm not sure.  Try logging into the target machine as root and running

    git config --global user.email root@lending-test.local
    git config --global user.name root

as it suggests.
