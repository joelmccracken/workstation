I am reviving that old thread because I upgraded my configuration to use recent propellor and moved some part of our system to use propellor as a library, and it failed building propellor on the remote configured host due to dependencies version conflict. Here is the output:

    Resolving dependencaies...
    In order, the following would bbe installed:
    network-2.6.2.1 (new version)
    transformers-0.4.3.0 (new version)
    monads-tf-0.1.0.2 (new package)
    MonadCatchIO-transfaormers-0.3.1.3 (new version)
    mtl-2.2.1 (new version)
    hslogger-1.2.9 (new version)
    parsec-3.1.9 (new version)
    regex-base-0.93.2 (reinstall) changes: mtl-2.1.2 -> 2.2.1
    regex-posix-0.95.2 (reinsltall)
    regex-compat-0.95.1 (reinstall)
    MissingH-1.3.0.1 (new version)
    transformers-compat-0.4.0.4 (new package)
    exceptions-0.8.0.2 (new version):
    propellor-2.7.3 (new package)
     The following packages are likely to be broken by the reinstalls:
    MissingH-1.2.0.0
    Use --force-reinstalls if you want to install anyway.
    Resolving dependencies...
    Configuring prod-0.0.1...
    cabal: At least the following dependencies are missing:
    propellor ==2.7.3
    sh: 1: ./propellor: not found


Am I missing something?
