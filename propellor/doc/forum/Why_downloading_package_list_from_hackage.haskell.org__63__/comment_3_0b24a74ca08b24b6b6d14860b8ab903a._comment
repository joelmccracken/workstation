The host has 128Mo of RAM :-). All dependencies should be available to apt-get, though... as it runs debian jessie. I used propellor on several other hosts running jessie also, and (it seems that) they didn't download the package list.

Downloading anything from hackage is problematic because cabal uses insecure http (potential MITM), and a new version of a dependency may introduce security holes.

As side note, stack may be an alternative to cabal in the case where apt can't find all the dependencies: it downloads everything securely, and stackage allows to deal with dependencies issues: the build may probably fail if new incompatible versions of propellor dependencies are released to hackage. Or maybe using strict versioning would be a solution there. Or maybe building propellor (at least for host with the same architecture) before sending it to the host?
