With recent snapshots of propellor (after at least March 11) I am seeing significant increases of memory consumed by ghc when compiling propellor. Previous versions would compile and run on e.g. a raspberry pi. With a recent snapshot, I am seeing ghc OOM with a 5GB ulimit on my desktop. Has anybody else seen this?

This is with the same version of GHC.

    % ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.10.3
