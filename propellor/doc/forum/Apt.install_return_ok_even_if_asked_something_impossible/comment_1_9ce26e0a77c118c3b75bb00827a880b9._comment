Implementation has:

	check (isInstallable ps) go

So, if the packages are not isInstallable, nothing is done, and the property
succeeds.

I think this check was intended to avoid running apt-get install unncessarily
when the packages are already installed. However, isInstalled doesn't
differentiate between a package being already installed and not available.

So, fixing.
