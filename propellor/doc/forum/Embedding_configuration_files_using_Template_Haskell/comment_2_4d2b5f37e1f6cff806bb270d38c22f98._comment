In that case, I will probably create a regular property for copying file contents. It seemed like a neat solution, but if it's not available everywhere I don't think it's worth it. I've also heard that there are problems with TH so it might be best to avoid it unless there is a compelling reason to use it.

I'm also thinking about using Data.Text.Template to template configuration files. With TH, the templates could be compiled and error-checked during build-time, kind of like what Yesod does. But again, I don't think it's worth the trouble.
