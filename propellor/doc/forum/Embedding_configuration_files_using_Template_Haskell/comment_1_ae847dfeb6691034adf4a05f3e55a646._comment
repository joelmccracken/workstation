I think this is fine if you want to do it that way, and it's nice how
short and simple the code is!

If you wanted to add this as a patch in mainline propellor, I'd need to
think about whether it makes sense to require working TH support to build
propellor. I guess all the systems I personally run propellor on now,
including the arm ones, have working TH, but there are certianly linux
architectures that don't support TH yet.

A build flag might be an option. Or, keep it in your local configuration,
since it is quite short-n-sweet.
