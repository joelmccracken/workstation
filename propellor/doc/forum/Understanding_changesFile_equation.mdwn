Hi, I'm trying to understand a part of the `changesFile` equation, specifically `oldstat`.

```
changesFile :: Checkable p i => p i -> FilePath -> Property i
changesFile p f = checkResult getstat comparestat p
  where
	getstat = catchMaybeIO $ getSymbolicLinkStatus f
	comparestat oldstat = do
		newstat <- getstat
		return $ if samestat oldstat newstat then NoChange else MadeChange
```

As we see, we catch `getstat` given `f`, but what I don't understand or see, is how is `oldstat` been passed/generated?

Thanks for the help.
