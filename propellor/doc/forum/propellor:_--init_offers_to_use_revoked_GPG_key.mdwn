Hi,

Using the Debian stable package (which downloaded and built the most recent version), `propellor --init` offered to use an expired GPG key. Details are below.

Thanks for another great piece of software, and thanks for using Haskell!

Kind regards,

    Propellor can use gpg to encrypt private data about the systems it manages,
    and to sign git commits.
    
    I see you have several gpg keys:
