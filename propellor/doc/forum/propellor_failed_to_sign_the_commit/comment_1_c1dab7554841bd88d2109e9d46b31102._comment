I guess the problem involves running propellor at a unix tty, not in a
GUI's virtual terminal?

My limited understanding of `GPG_TTY`, refreshed by re-reading this ooold
thread <https://bugs.debian.org/316388> is that gpg is normally able to
detect if it's in a GUI or at a tty, and will prompt in the tty if
necessary. Where that may fall down is when gpg is run with its stdio
connected to pipes, since then probably isatty fails. Although in at least
some cases, gpg apparently then 
[falls back to /dev/tty](https://dev.gnupg.org/T1434).

Propellor runs gpg with stdin and stdout piped to it when eg, decrypting
the privdata file. I tried `propellor --list-fields` at the linux console
and it fails there.

But, when I tried `propellor --spin host` at the linux console, that worked
ok, including making the gpg signed git commit. Of course git is running
gpg in this case, and perhaps my version of git has its own way to avoid
this problem.

This does seems like something propellor could work around fairly
inexpensively.
