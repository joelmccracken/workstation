We want to avoid adding heavy dependencies to propellor since that makes
propellor more expensive to bootstrap and adds a point of failure.

But, it should be easy enough to add dependencies to your own 
~/.propellor/config.cabal and write your properties using them. It would
also be fine to have additional libraries of propellor properties extending
propellor.

As for crypto hashes, it's certianly general enough to consider adding to
propellor, but it's also striking that propellor has mostly avoided needing
any hashes (except for some small uses of hashable and one place that
shells out to sha1). If there's a general purpose property that uses a
crypto hash, we could talk about adding it.
