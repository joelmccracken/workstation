Well, cabal files can have flags that enable additional dependencies, but
using them complicates testing the program since you have to try building
it with different combinations of flags. And deploying propellor with the
desired flags turned on would be an additional complication.

I feel that additional libraries that depend on propellor and the sql
library and provide properties is a better approach. The user can easily
add the dependency to their ~/.propellor/config.cabal, and the necessary
dependencies will be automatically installed when propellor is deploying
itself to a new host.
