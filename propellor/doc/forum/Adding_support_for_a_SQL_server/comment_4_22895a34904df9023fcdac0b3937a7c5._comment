Hello,

I have made a first version to support MySQL databases and users for classic web applications.

You can pull the mysql branch at http://git.ni.fr.eu.org/nicolas/propellor.git

Can you have a look? I find userGrantedOnDatabase.setup' a little hard to read. Is it OK, or do you see a clearer way to write it?

Thanks!
