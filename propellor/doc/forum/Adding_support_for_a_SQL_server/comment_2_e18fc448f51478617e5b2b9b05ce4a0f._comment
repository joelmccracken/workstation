I am looking for a solution which could be integrated to propellor. Is it possible to include those additional libraries in propellor sources and have them included in the build on demand? I am not very familiar with the haskell build systems.

About generated passwords, a nice solution would be to do it in PrivData.  The user would provide a salt as the private data and it would be combined to context to generate a password.  I can try find how this could be done.
