Hello,

I have made a second version.

About reverting `installed`, I noticed that it only removes the meta package, which is quite useless. May be I should just drop revertability on this one.

The problem of installing a software just to revert a property can also be seen in `Apache.modEnabled` for exemple.

Any comments are welcome.

Thanks.
