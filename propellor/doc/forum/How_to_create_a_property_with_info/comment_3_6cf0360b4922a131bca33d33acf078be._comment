Finding a way to type check that, I don't know. It would certianly be nice
to be able to statically check such things. The way that Info is
implemented as a monoid that contains many different types seems to
preclude exposing enough information for the type checker to catch such a
problem. So it would have to be changed somehow, I don't know how.
