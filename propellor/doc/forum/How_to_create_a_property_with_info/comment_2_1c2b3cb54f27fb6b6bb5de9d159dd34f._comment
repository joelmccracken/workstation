I could have multiple host with debomatic install on it.
I need to create a property which take a list of hosts (all with the Debomatic info) in order to generate the sources.list files.
This way it is possible for me to select per host the sources of packages.

what should be done in order to type check this ?
I would like the compiler to says. Hey you ask for a source list from this host but it dos not contain a Debian mirror.

Cheers
