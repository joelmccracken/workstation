I get `Just UTF-8` in both cases and the corruption is not fixed. I think the problem may be on the _receiving_ side? On macOS my `$LC_CTYPE` is set to `\"UTF-8\"` which is passed through by SSH but is an invalid locale on Linux. Running `env LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8 ./propellor --spin blah` fixes the corruption.
