Sounds like a problem with sendPrivData, which writes it to a Handle that's 
connected to propellor on the host being spun.

Handles have an associated encoding, which comes from the locale settings.
The char8 TextEncoding sounds like what you describe (code point modulo
256). hSetEncoding can change it.

Here's a patch you could try that prints out the encoding in use and tries
to force utf8.
