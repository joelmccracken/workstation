Ah, good debugging!

The code that runs on the remote side is Propellor.Spin.update,
and it uses Propellor.Protocol.req which reads from stdin. So,
I think that putting `hSetEncoding stdin utf8` in the update function
may fix it for you.

If so, the real fix will involve making propellor force utf8 on both sides
of its protocol, because the spin might be run in some other locale too.
(Or chainging to a binary protocol that doesn't suffer 
from encoding mismatch problems, if someone is ambitious!)
