I don't think that anyone has integrated it with LDAP yet.

It's easy to use propellor from another location; just put the propellor 
git repository anywhere you want, use `make` to build it once,
and run `./propellor` thereafter.

The only thing that hardcodes using ~/.propellor is the /usr/bin/propellor
wrapper, by running the propellor you built yourself you bypass the need
for the wrapper. I keep propellor in ~/src/propellor on my laptop 
and run it this way myself.
