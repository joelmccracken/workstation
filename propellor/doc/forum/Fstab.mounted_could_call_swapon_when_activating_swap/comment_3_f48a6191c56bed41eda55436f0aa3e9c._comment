I like the idea of composing smaller properties to build the current
property, and add flexability.

Renaming the existing `fstabbed` would probably be too much bother.
(Also, I think I picked that name because it kind of hints that the
existing fstab does not come out alive.)

(The swapspace package is great if you can eat the now tiny overhead of a
swap file compared to a swap partition.)
