This idea kind of makes sense, because swap partitions in /etc/fstab
get swaponed at boot.

But, the implementation doesn't take the types into account. The `mounted`
property takes a FilePath for the mountpoint, but for swap that
needs to be "none", which is not really a file-path. Also, the `fstabbed`
property has a separate `SwapPartition` type, so making `mount` support
swap partitions without using that type feels wrong.

It might be simpler all round to treat swap partitions being able to
be specified in /etc/fstab as a historical accident, which it kind of
is (increasingly so, since eg systemd has other ways to accomplish
that), and instead of shoehorning this into the `mounted` property,
add a new `swaponed` property.
