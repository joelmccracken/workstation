Merged. Have not tested it either.

On my Debian system, the swapon command does not support the
`--no-headings` that you used. It's `--noheadings` here. Is that a typo in
your patch?

I've simply removed that option for now, since it probably won't
hurt if it treats the heading like another device that's swapped on.
