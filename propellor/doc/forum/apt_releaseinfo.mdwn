Since apt-get has changed behavior and refuses to update if the code name
in a Release file has changed from the one it saw before, propellor systems
that are tracking Unstable or Testing need a manual intervention after each
major stable release (`apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change`).

(It seems that when unattended-updates is available, it does automatically
accept the change.)

I am seeking advice about what propellor should do about this. Should 
Apt.update include --allow-releaseinfo-change when the host is following a
rolling suite? 

Or does doing so defeat whatever presumably good rationalle there is for
making this a manual action? Or perhaps there is no really good reason apt
does this when following a folling suite?
