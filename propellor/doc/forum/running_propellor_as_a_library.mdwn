I would like to define my propellor configuration using propellor as a library dependency, which removes the need to fork source repo, merge...
I encounter an issue when trying to use propellor in that way: Everything under `Utility/` is not exported by the propellor, so cannot be used from my own properties. This is annoying because there are interesting things to build properties, like running processes...

Would you consider exposing those modules, maybe through some other module like `Propellor.Utility` ?
