Ah right, [[todo/support_for_libvirt_KVM_VMs]];
your patch is kind of a prerequisite for that. Pulling the kernel and
initrd out of the chroot is a good idea!

"Host" is slightly ambiguous around disk image building because
a disk image can be built for a Host by `imageBuiltFor`. I've gone ahead
and merged it in with the NoBootloader name.
