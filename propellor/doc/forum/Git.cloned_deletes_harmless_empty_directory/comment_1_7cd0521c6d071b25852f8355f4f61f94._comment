I am not entirely happy with this patch, because it seems that if
Git.cloned took care to preserve permissions in this case, it could be
argued that it should also preserve permissions when the directory already
exists but has the wrong content. Or equally well argued that it should not
preserve permissions, which might be a leftover from some past unwanted
state.

Is that really the best way to do it? You could instead say:

	Git.cloned user repo dir Nothing
		`onChange` recursiveSetGID user dir

And then you just have to write a recursiveSetGID which would be a
generally useful property.
