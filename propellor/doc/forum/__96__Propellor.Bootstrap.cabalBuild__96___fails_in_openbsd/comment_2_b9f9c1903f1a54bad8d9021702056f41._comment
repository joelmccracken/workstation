I think you're right, `-pf` should be sufficient.

> If you're going to be posting a bunch of openbsd porting patches, which I hope you are, please use [[/todo]] so they don't flood the forum and so it's obvious which have been applied and which not.

Apologies for the haste. I'll post patches under [[/todo]] in<br/>
the future and take a look at [[/contributing]]. Thanks for<br/>
pointing out.
