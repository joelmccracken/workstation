Thanks for the patch. I've applied it. I suspect it would be sufficient to
use -p?<Down>

If you're going to be posting a bunch of openbsd porting patches,
which I hope you are, please use [[todo]] so they don't flood the forum
and so it's obvious which have been applied and which not.

Also, see [[contributing]] for some other useful things to do.
