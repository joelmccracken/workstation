Hello, I try to copy a vm image to a directory like this

    & "/nfs/share-temp/panbox-rel.img" `File.isCopyOf` panboxName


but when I run this, I get this error message

    sixs3.exp.synchrotron-soleil.fr /root/vm/panbox-rel.img owner picca:grp-instrumentation ... done
    cp: failed to preserve ownership for '/nfs/share-temp/panbox-rel.img.propellor-new~': Operation not permitted
    ** error: cp failed
    ** warning: Cannot continue!
    CallStack (from HasCallStack):
      error, called at src/Propellor/Message.hs:143:9 in propellor-5.6.0-GGUJL7KihFnDmzjFSP3dov:Propellor.Message
    sixs3.exp.synchrotron-soleil.fr /nfs/share-temp/panbox-rel.img is copy of /root/vm/panbox-rel.img ... failed

I understand thaht it is not possible to use cp --preserve... on the nfs system.

So is seems that Propellor miss a copyFile whcih is usable also on nfs system :).
what is the best way to solve this problem.

I can copy the file without the preserve flag.

Cheers

Fred
