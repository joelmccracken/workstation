Hey all, I just thought I'd mention I'm working on porting Propellor to FreeBSD. Here's my [GitHub fork](https://github.com/misandrist/propellor/tree/FreeBSD), and the branch is called FreeBSD.

Currently:

- I've started passing the System down into the Bootstrap to choose the right shell commands and package dependencies
- I've briefly commented out the Cron job creation
- I've added a module for FreeBSD, and a really minimal property for Pkg
- I've created a sample configuration which is only tests pkg update

It's pretty encouraging so far, and I'm hoping to have more working soon.

Thanks!
