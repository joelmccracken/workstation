Thanks for the information,

Now I use the provision part but I am facing a problem when I try to create the chroot using withTmpDir
I do not understand exactly how it must work

here the signature of my two methods

    sbuild :: System -> RevertableProperty
    sbuild system = withTmpDir \"sbuild\" $ \tmpdir -> sbuild' system tmpdir

And here the property which does the work (it works thanks to your comment, I will have other questions about this part later ;)

    sbuild' :: System -> FilePath -> RevertableProperty
    sbuild' system chrootdir = mksbuild `requires` create
    ...

When I tried this I got this error

    src/config.hs:166:17:
        Couldn't match expected type `RevertableProperty'
                    with actual type `m0 RevertableProperty'
        In the expression:
          withTmpDir \"sbuild\" $ \ tmpdir -> return $ sbuild' system tmpdir
        In an equation for `sbuild':
            sbuild system
              = withTmpDir \"sbuild\" $ \ tmpdir -> return $ sbuild' system tmpdir

I need to extract the property from the monad, but I do not know how ?
