        Couldn't match expected type `RevertableProperty'
                    with actual type `m0 a0'
        In the expression:
          withTmpDir \"sbuild\" $ \ tmpdir -> sbuild' system tmpdir
        In an equation for `sbuild':
            sbuild system
              = withTmpDir \"sbuild\" $ \ tmpdir -> sbuild' system tmpdir
