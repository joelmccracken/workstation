This could the plan, but I am not very confident that my code is generic enought.

In this case I do not like the way I give the chroot to the sbuild method.
In fact I do not find the interface of this command generic enought.

There is assumtions in the code:
 - the initial configuration of sbuild was done
 - the chrootdir is hardcoded into /var/lib/sbuild and I do not know if this is the right way to do things.

If you would have some advices about interface, because it seems to me thaht you are great for this :)
