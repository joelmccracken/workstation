Hello,

I would like to add support for MySQL/MariaDB and I have some questions about it.

I suppose the nicest way to do it would be to use some haskell binding and to
connect directly to the server from propellor.  However, this would add a
dependency to build it.  Is it acceptable?

Another solution is to use a command line client and parse its output, but the
SQL syntax is so strange that I fear this will be painful.

Another question is about password generation as I will need many passwords, I
would like to generate them using a crypto hash of a secret combined with a
public part in the propellor config.  Do you have a suggestion to compute this
hash?  I think a dependency on a hash library is easier to accept.

Thanks.
