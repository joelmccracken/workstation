If you look at `setPrivDataTo`, it explicitly chomps all trailing newlines
from the value. I think that I did that because it's easy to accidentially
add a newline you don't want when eg, pasting in a password.

So, one solution might be to make --set --from-file load
a file into privdata as-is. But, that seems like complication;
you'd need to remember when to use it.

I think it's better for the ssh property (and any other affected
properties) to be changed, to add a final newline to the value from
privdata when one is missing. Does this problem only affect ed25519
keys, or others too? Only private keys or also public?

I am currently extremely busy, so a patch would be great.
