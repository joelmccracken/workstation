Propellor.Property.Git.cloned clones a git repo to a location, great! Is there an easy way to keep it updated afterwards, though? I guess having a property that enforce up-to-dateness wouldn't be so practical since you have to hit the remote to check, perhaps a cron job to run some equivalent of `git fetch && git reset --hard && git clean -dfx`. (Just thinking out loud here, and wondering what everyone else is doing)
