    SHARING A CACHE
       A group of developers can increase the cache hit rate by sharing a cache directory. To share a cache without unpleasant side effects, the following conditions should to be met:

       ·   Use the same CCACHE_DIR environment variable setting.

       ·   Unset the CCACHE_HARDLINK environment variable.

       ·   Make sure everyone sets the CCACHE_UMASK environment variable to 002. This ensures that cached files are accessible to everyone in the group.

       ·   Make sure that all users have write permission in the entire cache directory (and that you trust all users of the shared cache).

       ·   Make sure that the setgid bit is set on all directories in the cache. This tells the filesystem to inherit group ownership for new directories. The command “find $CCACHE_DIR -type d | xargs chmod
           g+s” might be useful for this.

       The reason to avoid the hard link mode is that the hard links cause unwanted side effects, as all links to a cached file share the file’s modification timestamp. This results in false dependencies to
       be triggered by timestamp-based build systems whenever another user links to an existing file. Typically, users will see that their libraries and binaries are relinked without reason.

       You may also want to make sure that the developers have CCACHE_BASEDIR set appropriately, as discussed in the previous section

it seems that a a setgid bit is required for all directory.
