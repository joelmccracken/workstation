I generally try to fix up after bugs in the implementation of properties,
because otherwise maintaining my hosts gets problimatic.

In this case, the sbuild support is pretty new and probably not much
used, so I guess it's up to you. chmod -R is rather expensive. If there's
a cheap way to detect when that's needed and only run it then, that
would be ideal..
