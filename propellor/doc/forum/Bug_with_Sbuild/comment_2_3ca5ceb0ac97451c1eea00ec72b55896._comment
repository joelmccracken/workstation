Thank you for reporting this and for finding the fix, Fred.  In a branch I'll be submitting soon I have modified `Ccache.hasCache` to chmod setgid the cache root, and this should propagate to all newly created subdirectories.

Joey: what do you think about adding `cmdProperty \"chmod\" [\"-R\", \"g+s\" \"/var/cache/ccache-foo\"]` to `Ccache.hasCache` to fix existing broken setups?  In my view it would be better to just add a note to the changelog suggesting this fix, but I'm not sure what you think would be best.
