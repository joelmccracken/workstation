Today for some reason I had one run produce more output, with many repeats of the same warning. It seems to be more than a warning, since the corresponding properties fail. I have rebooted the VM, in case there was some transient resource exhaustion problem.  Successive runs of /usr/local/bin/propellor_cronjob stop very early as in my original report.
