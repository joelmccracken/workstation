Sounds like you may want to write a program that uses propellor as a
library. `Propellor.Engine.mainProperties` is a reasonable
entry point, just pass it a Host that has the properties you want
to run.

For example:

	import Propellor
	import Propellor.Engine
	import Propellor.Property.DiskImage

	main :: IO ()
	main = mainProperties $ host "whatever" $ props
		& imageBuilt "/some/disk.img" ...
