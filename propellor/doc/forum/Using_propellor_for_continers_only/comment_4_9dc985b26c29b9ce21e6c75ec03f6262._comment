The way propellor handles running in a chroot or container is it exports
its binary and support files into the container. This way the
haskell code can run in a container, rather than being limited to
only running shell commands in the container, and without needing ghc in
the container.

It does use the hardcoded `localdir` for that.
It would certianly be possible to make it use propellor in a different
location, perhaps using `getExecutablePath`.

Since the git-annex outside the container passes command-line options to
the one running inside the container to tell it what to do, using
`mainProperties` would also not work since that does not look at
command-line options. It would need to use `defaultMain` or
`processCmdLine` and dispatch itself, or something..
