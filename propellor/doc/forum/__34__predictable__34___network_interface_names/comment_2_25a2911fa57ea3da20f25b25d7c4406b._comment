I guess that's a more productive line of thinking, I wouldn't expect these vm's to have more than one network interface. One gotcha that took a bit to figure out is that the masking needs update-initramfs to be seen at boot. The following seems to be working for me:

[[!format haskell \"\"\"
& File.hasContent \"/etc/systemd/network/99-default.link\" []
        `onChange` ( Cmd.cmdProperty \"update-initramfs\" [\"-u\"] `changesFile` \"/initrd.img\" )
\"\"\"]]
"""]]
