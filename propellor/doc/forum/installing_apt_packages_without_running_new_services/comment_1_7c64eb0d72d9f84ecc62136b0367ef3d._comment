One way is to enable Propellor.Property.Service.noServices
during the install and revert it afterwards, but that does prevent any
services being started while it's enabled.

I don't know of a very good way to do this on a Debian system. If you can
find one, I'm sure propellor can use it.

It might be possible, when systemd is used, to first apply
Propellor.Property.Systemd.disabled on the service that has not been
installed yet. I have not checked if that works.
