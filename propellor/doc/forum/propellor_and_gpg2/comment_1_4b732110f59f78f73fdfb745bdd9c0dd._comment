The bottom line on this is that gpg2 (via the agent and pinentry) doesn't prompt correctly when run from git. It does when run directly.

One fix is to set GPG_TTY before running propellor: `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` or some such.

Anything else that caches the pass phrase in the agent works too since that removes the need to prompt.
