Hi again,

Thanks for the swift answer. As I am not (yet ?-) an expert of either Haskell or Propellor I'd prefer to be sure before going further.
Your proposal is to somehow «copy» the machinery of Apt.installed and Apt.reConfigure but using this time «createProcess with {cwd = whatever}». And I should find useful examples/snippets to implement this in the Property.DnsSec.forceZoneSigned sources.

If I manage that I'll definitely propose a contribution on it :-)

By the way, thanks for the complete system. As often elegance comes with a great quality of use !

Serge.
