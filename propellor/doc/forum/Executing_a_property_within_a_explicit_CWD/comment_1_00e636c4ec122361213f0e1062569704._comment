Since propellor can run multiple properties at the same time
(Propellor.Property.Concurrent), setting the CWD while running a property
is probably not a good idea, as it would affect any other property that's
currently running. Might be possible to fork and set CWD, 
but haskell is not great at supporting fork w/o exec.

Instead, the best way to do it is to use `createProcess` with
`{cwd = whatever}` when your property runs apt and dpkg-reconfigure.
See Property.DnsSec.forceZoneSigned for an example.
