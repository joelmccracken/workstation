Hi,

I'd like to run propellor differently:

- create a static binary from `config.hs`.
- upload it to the target machine (which can be ARM, do not have GHC, et al).
- run it.

Propellor would build the binary if I ask it to with `propellor --build`; not static yet, but I think I can figure it out.

How would I run a propellor binary on the local host, without trying to connect anywhere? I would be grateful if you could suggest an approach.

Thank you!
