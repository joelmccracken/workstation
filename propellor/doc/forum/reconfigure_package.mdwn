Hello,it would be nice to have the possibility to reconfigure a package without giving debconf selection

this way it would be possible to just ask for a package reconfiguration.

exemple the libdvd-pkg need to be reconfigure after installtion in order to install the dvdcss part.

will it be possible for you to change the signature of reconfigure

from

reConfigure :: Package -> [(String, String, String)] -> Property NoInfo

to

reConfigure :: Package -> Maybe [(String, String, String)] -> Property NoInfo
