What's the use case here?

I think maybe you're trying to deploy basically the same set of properties
to multiple hosts. And perhaps don't want to have the list of hosts in the
config.hs file. If that's the goal, it seems you could accomplish it by
writing a function like:

	stdHost :: IPAddr -> Host

Or more generally,

	stdHost :: Property HasInfo -> Host

And then you can map over the set of IP addresses to generate the the
[Host] list for propellor. Or could even read a data file (that would need
to be checked into the git repo) and use it to constuct the [Host] list at
runtime.

But maybe I misunderstood the use case..
