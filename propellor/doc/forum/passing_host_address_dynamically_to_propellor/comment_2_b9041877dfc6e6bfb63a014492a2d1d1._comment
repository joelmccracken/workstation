We create/destroy dynamically hosts which have different purpose: CI, Dev boxes, Testing... IP of these hosts is unknown and assign by our provider (Digital Ocean) so what I would like to do is something like:

```
$ create-host
...
IP: 1.2.3.4
$ ./propellor 1.2.3.4
```

But indeed the idea of having a local `hosts` file makes sense, or even a `hosts/` directory to which I output files containing IPs.
