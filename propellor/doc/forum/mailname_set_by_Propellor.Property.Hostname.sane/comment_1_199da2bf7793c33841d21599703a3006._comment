Well, for a hostname like "foo.example.com", it's right to use example.com
for the mailname. OTOH, for hostname "example.com", it currently uses
"com" for the mailname, which is certianly wrong. (It also uses "example"
for the hostname, which I dunno if is right or not, probably a matter of
opinion.)

I've special cased it to require at least one dot in the domain, and
parameterized domain extraction for cases where the default method
doesn't work.
