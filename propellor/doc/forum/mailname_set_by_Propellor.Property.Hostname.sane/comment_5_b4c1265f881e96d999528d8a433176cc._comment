I worked around the problem in the following way:

    module Propellor.Property.SiteSpecific.SPW.Hostname (sane) where

    import Propellor.Base
    import qualified Propellor.Property.Hostname as Hostname

    sane :: Property UnixLike
    sane = Hostname.sane' id

> How about we add a separate mailname property and make Hostname.sane not touch the mailname. mailname could take a Maybe and guess based on the hostname when Nothing is specified.

This seems reasonable.  `Hostname.sane` is often wanted but `Mailname.sane` will be wanted only occasionally, so it makes sense for them to be separate properties.

> Or, the mailname property could only set Info, and Hostname.sane use that info when set and guess when not. But, I suspect that would not have avoided your email-losing misconfiguration from happening in the first place.

This wouldn't be much different from my workaround, indeed.
