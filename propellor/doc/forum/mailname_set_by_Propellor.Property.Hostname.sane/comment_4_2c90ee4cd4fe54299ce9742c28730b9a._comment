I notice that the property is certianly wrong for domains such as
"foo.org.uk". And I don't want to build in the list of exceptions needed to
properly deal with those.

How about we add a separate mailname property and make Hostname.sane not
touch the mailname. mailname could take a Maybe and guess based on the
hostname when Nothing is specified.

Or, the mailname property could only set Info, and Hostname.sane
use that info when set and guess when not. But, I suspect that would not
have avoided your email-losing misconfiguration from happening in the first
place.
