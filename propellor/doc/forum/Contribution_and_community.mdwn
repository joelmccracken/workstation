Propellor seems inaccessible to me.

The contribution workflow is based on emails or unstructured todo wiki subpages. It is unclear where to get help.

I suggest you switch to using https://gitlab.haskell.org for example

Getting contributions in open source is about how accessible your project is. That includes not only codebase, but especially workflow.
I also barely see anyone respond to propellor topics on #haskell freenode.

We use propellor at work and I'm already wondering if ansible would have been a better choice.
