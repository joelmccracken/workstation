If you update by merging from Joey's repo but have the Debian propellor package installed you'll always get this because the bundle in `/usr/src/propellor` has a commit ID that is distinct from any of those in Joey's branch.

I think it would be nice to have a git config option to disable the check for those of us in the situation I just described.
