Hello, I think that my problem is related to this one.

I have a repository created from the Debian package and which is from the 5.1.0 version.
I just upgrade the package to 5.3.1 and now I do not have the message explaining that a new upstream version is available.
So I do not know how to upgrade my current repository.

Before, I just had to do

    git merge upstream/master

And now ?


thanks for your help
