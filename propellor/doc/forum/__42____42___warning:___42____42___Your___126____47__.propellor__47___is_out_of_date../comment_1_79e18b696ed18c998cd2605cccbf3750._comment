You'd update it by git merge with propellor upstream, since your ~/.propellor
in this case is forked from propellor's git repository, rather than the other
option of being a separate git repository that uses propellor as a library.

I think there should be more to the message than what you showed,
explaining what you'd to do merge.

        warningMessage ("** Your ~/.propellor/ is out of date..")
        let also s = hPutStrLn stderr ("   " ++ s)
        also ("A newer upstream version is available in " ++ distrepo)
        if havebranch
                then also ("To merge it, run: git merge " ++ upstreambranch)
                else also ("To merge it, find the most recent commit in your repository's history that corresponds to an upstream release of propellor, and set refs/remotes/" ++ upstreambranch ++ " to it. Then run propellor again.")
