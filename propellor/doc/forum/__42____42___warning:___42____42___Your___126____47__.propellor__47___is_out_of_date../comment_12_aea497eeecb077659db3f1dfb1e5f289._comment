What propellor --init sets up, when you select the clone option
and the Debian package is installed, is no remote
defined, but a remotes/upsteam/master tracking branch.

So not normally this:

    upstream        /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git (fetch)

Aha! The very first revision of propellor --init
*did* set up an upstream remote pointing at the distrepo. At some point
that changed to the above described behavior. You're bitten by being an
early adopter.

I've adjusted the logic to handle that case.
