The warning is printed twice.

One at the very beginning:

	stappers@paddy:~
	$ propellor paddy.gpm.stappers.nl
	   A newer upstream version is available in /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git
	   To merge it, run: git merge upstream/master
	   
	[2018-01-01 16:42:54 CET] command line:  Run \"paddy.gpm.stappers.nl\"


The other at the end of executing:

	loop deleted : /dev/loop0
	paddy.gpm.stappers.nl built disk image /srv/image/lime.img ... done
	paddy.gpm.stappers.nl overall ... done
	Shared connection to paddy.gpm.stappers.nl closed.
	** warning: ** Your ~/.propellor/ is out of date..
	stappers@paddy:~
	$ 

It was the last one that made me report this.
The one that is color highlighted,
the one that doesn't have the `git merge` advice.
