This seems like it would be a useful addition to propellor.

As to commits made by propellor --spin during development, those typically
involve changes to my own configuration, or minor changes, but sometimes
other changes slip into one of those commits during the press of sysadmin
events. I doh't see how those would prevent you from sending patches though.
