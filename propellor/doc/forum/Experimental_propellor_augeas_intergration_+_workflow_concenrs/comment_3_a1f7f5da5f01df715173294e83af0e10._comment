I'm generally happy to accept new modules into propellor. However, this one
is problimatic since it adds several new dependencies. I want to keep
propellor's dependencies minimal.

It could be integrated behind a flag in propellor.cabal, but then I'd need
to worry about testing it (or not testing it) for integration when there
are changes.

So, maybe this works better as an addon module? A propellor user could then
add it to their config.hs. Only problem I see is, it currently depends on
propellor, so a user can't modify their propellor.cabal to depend on it.
So you'd have to use propellor as a library.
