Sure, look at how `Container` is defined:

	data Container = Container MachineName Chroot.Chroot Host

Getting a Host out of that is easy. :)

	getContainerHost (Container _ _ h) = h

(Has to be put inside the Systemd module as it does not export the
Container constructor.)

That's specific to systemd containers, other container systems
have different data types. Here's the one from the Docker module:

	data Container = Container Image Host

If you wanted to you could even make a type class that these and other
containers are part of, with a method to extract the Host. I would be happy
to merge such a patch.

And yeah, this seems like a good way around wanting to get otherwise
unpropigated info out of containers. It's worth noting that the Host
inside a systemd Container has as its hostname the MachineName used
for the container.
