After thinking about it, it would be nicer if an Host could give information about
several of its children, that would be a larger change, but having the wrapper
would then be useless and propellor would be able to find containers
automatically.

As a container is created by a property, a container Host could be included in
Info of a Host. If an entry is to be propagated, then it is added as an entry
of the host, else it is kept as an entry of the container.

When looking up a host, we have to search for one Host of a [Host] list, but
also for any Host listed in the containersInfo of all the listed Host.

Not sure this is clear, here is a example to try to make it clearer:

    hard_node :: Host
        hostName = \"hard-node.example.org\"
        hostProperties = ...
        hostInfo =
            [ a HostKeyInfo for riva
            , a DnsInfoUnpropagated for riva
            , a DnsInfoPropagated from container-web
            , a ContainersInfo =
                [ container_web :: Host
                    hostName = \"container-web\"
                    hostProperties = ...
                    hostInfo =
                        [ a HostKeyInfo for container-web
                        , a DnsInfoUnpropagated for container-web
                        ]
                , container_git :: Host
                    ...
                ]
            ]
