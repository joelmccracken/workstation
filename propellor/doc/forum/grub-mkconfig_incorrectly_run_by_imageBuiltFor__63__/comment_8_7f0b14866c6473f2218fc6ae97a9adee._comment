The debian grub-pc package creates /boot/grub in its postinst.

It seems that grub-coreboot does not. I don't know why.
Seems like it could be considered a bug to me; installing the package
and then running grub-mkconfig ought to just work.  I'm going to file a bug
report.

Anyway, I suppose propellor ought to work around the bug by making sure
/boot/grub exists.
