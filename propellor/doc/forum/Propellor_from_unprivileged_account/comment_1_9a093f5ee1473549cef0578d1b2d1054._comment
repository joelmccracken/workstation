Well propellor is normally built in the user's home directory and then
deploys updates to the hosts and is built and run as root on them.

If you're wanting to only run propellor as a user, to manage some
user-specific properties, see the Propellor.Location module to change
the path where propellor depploys itself to on a host. 

And in Propellor.Spin it has several `"root@"` that you'd need to change to
make it ssh into the host as a different user.

And, in Propellor.CmdLine, there's a check of `getRealUserID` to see if it's
running as root. 

I think that's everything that assumes root (aside from a great many
properties of course!), but can't swear to it.
