Hello Joey,

here the onfiguration of my propellor repro.

    [remote "origin"]
        url = git+ssh://git.debian.org/git/users/picca/propellor
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

I use this central repository to manage a bunch of computers.
The problem I is that all these computer do have acces only from this url

    [remote "origin"]
        url = https://anonscm.debian.org/git/users/picca/propellor.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

So I can use the deploy branch trick.

BUT

since I have clone of the first repository (in order to push via ssh) on all of these computer (let call them locals), I need to add
the deploy branch on all of them.

So I tryed to add this directly in the propellor configuration.

      & PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl "https://anonscm.debian.org/git/users/picca/propellor.git"

But when I do the spin for the first time from the locals, the url put in the /usr/local/propellor/.git/config files
is the one from the locals cloned repository which is the ssh adress and not the https one.

So the propellor spin stop with a timeout because it tryes to  git fetch  with the wrong url.


My question is  is it normal ?


PS: I also tryed to add

  & bootstrappedFrom (GitRepoUrl "https://anonscm.debian.org/git/users/picca/propellor.git")

but the result was the same.


Cheers
