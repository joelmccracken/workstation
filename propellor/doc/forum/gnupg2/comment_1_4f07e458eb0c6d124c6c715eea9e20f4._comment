The two are very command-line compatable, and I'd be surprised if propellor
hits any incompatabilities.

So, if your distribution has a way to make "gpg" run gpg2, that should d
it. If not, `git grep '"gpg"'` will find the few places the command name
needs to be changed. Those could be centralized into one place for easier
configuation; send patches.
