Managed to reproduce the hang once, and the ssh was indeed being run as
bgProcess. However, I didn't manage to see what foreground process, if any,
was running when that happened. And had no luck reproducing it again.

I added some more `PROPELLOR_DEBUG` output around this, so it'll tell
when a process is being run by fgProcess or bgProcess.
