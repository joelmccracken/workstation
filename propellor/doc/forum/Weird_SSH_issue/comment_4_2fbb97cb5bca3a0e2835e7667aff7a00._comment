Added some debugging, I found that processes run by concurrent-output tend to
alternate between running foreground and background. So, when the socket
exists and is old, it will run one more process than otherwise to
stop ssh on that socket, and this will change which run method is
used for subsequent processes.

However, it really shouldn't matter if a process starts in the background;
concurrent-output shoud notice when the output lock frees up, and start
displaying the processes's output.

So, this theory explains why the ssh socket seems to be involved, perhaps,
but it doesn't really explain what's happening to prevent the remote
propellor output from being shown.

Unless some other foreground process is hanging around and keeping
the output lock. Or some bug in concurrent-output..
