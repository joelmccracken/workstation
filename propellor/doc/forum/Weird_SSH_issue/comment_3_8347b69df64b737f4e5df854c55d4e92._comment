It also seemed to affect the first spin and not the second one when I was
seeing it. But that was 1-2 weeks ago, and I am not currently reproducing
the issue.

If you can reproduce it consistently, it would be good to check if the
concurrent output layer, which involves intercepting all command output and
serializing it, might be involved. If you edit
`src/Utility/Process/Shim.hs` and make it simply `import System.Process as X`
and remove the other import, that will bypass the concurrent output layer.
