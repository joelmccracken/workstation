Indeed, I can see how etckeeper provides a very easy way to check exactly what has changed to /etc (also) after a propellor spin. When I'm manually editing an /etc file I know what the changes are, but not so when a tool does it for me. So, it's important to verify, for example, that propellor did indeed what I *thought* I told it to do (not sure if propellor has an option to report the /etc changes it did).

By using both etckeeper and propellor, which one do you consider to have the authoritative status (power?) over /etc? Do you still manually edit /etc files?
