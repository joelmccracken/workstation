I use both. To be fully described by the propellor configuration, it would
need to pin the system to a specific version of every package installed on
it, and that's generally not practical because there are new security
updates all the time. It's useful to have etckeeper keeping track of
changes made to configuration during upgrades.

I do find etckeeper generally less useful on those type of systems, but it
still more than pays for itself.
