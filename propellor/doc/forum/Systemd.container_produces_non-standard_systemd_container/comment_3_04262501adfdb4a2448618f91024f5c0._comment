You can see the difference here:

```
mycontainer     directory no  n/a    n/a                          n/a     
testclone       subvolume no  60M    Thu 2015-09-24 22:41:39 CEST n/a     
```

Your container is a directory while the clone is a subvolume (of btrfs). Cloning the machine involves doing some btrfs magic I would assume (with no `cp -a` backup). The error message could be more descriptiveâ€¦
