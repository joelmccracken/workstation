       clone NAME NAME
           Clones a container or VM image. The arguments specify the
           name of the image to clone and the name of the newly
           cloned image. Note that plain directory container images
           are cloned into subvolume images with this command.

That seems to say that the directory that Systemd.container sets up
should be clonable too. Perhaps this is a systemd bug?

If systemd needs a container to be loaded from a tarball in order to be
clonable this way, I guess I would not mind if Systemd.container did that
as part of its initial bootstrapping. But it is extra work so I'd like to
make sure that it's really intended to need to do that.

(Myself, I don't care if I can't clone a container; I can delete any of them
and propellor can rebuild them, or even move the line to a different host
in config.hs to relocate the container.)
