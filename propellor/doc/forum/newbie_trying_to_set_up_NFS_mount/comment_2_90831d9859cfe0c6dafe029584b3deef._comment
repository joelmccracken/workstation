I agreed with you joey, we need to be able to add mount point directly into the fstab file in order to let the world know about all the mount points.
Maybe a way also to generate the mount point with the system d syntax.

So maybe the best solution is to have a DSL (like you did in you dism system) and then generators for fstab, systemd, etc...
This property should be revertable in order to add or remove lines (files).

the fstab should also contain some invariant code (the lines generated during the system installation). I speak about Debian installation.

Cheers
