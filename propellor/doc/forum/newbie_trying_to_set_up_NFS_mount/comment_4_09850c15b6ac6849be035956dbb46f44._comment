That's quite a nice elegant solution, Frederik!

It'll work if you use

	`onChange` (cmdProperty "mount" ["-a"] `assume` MadeChange)

This is ncessary because propellor doesn't know if `cmdProperty`
makes a change or not. In this case we can just assume it did.

I've added a `Propellor.Property.Fstab.mounted` this evening
that is essentially Frederik's solution.
