Not aware of anyone using propellor for that yet.

Propellor's LVM module would probably be a decent starting point for
implementing dm-crypt support.

Key/passwords could certianly be managed with propellor's privdata
interface. Whether it makes sense to do so for security is probably up to
the individual user, since privdata can be decrypted with your gpg private
key, which you might not want to equate to access to your encrypted volume.
Also, privdata is stored on the host that uses it in unencrypted form
protected only by file permissions.
