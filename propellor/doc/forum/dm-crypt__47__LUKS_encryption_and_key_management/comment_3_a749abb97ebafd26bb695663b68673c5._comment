Storing plaintext luks passwords on disk doesn't sound great for most applications, but I wonder if the encrypted form could be stored in privdata. Something using e.g. \"cryptsetup luksDump\" or \"cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup\". I have no idea how practical it is to generate such data without being logged into the machine in question.
