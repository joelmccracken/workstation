I got a patch some years back to make propellor compile on OSX.
I merged it. You might want to get in touch with its author, as
he may be doing something with propellor on OSX.
<https://github.com/tittoassini/propellor>

Anyway, I'd probably merge OSX patches, if they were not super
intrusive. And I don't see why it would be, as propellor already supports
FreeBSD.

Since `Property` is parameterized by the operating systems it
supports, it should be easy to start by only porting the core parts
of propellor, and then port over individual Properties one by one as
needed. See the commits for the recent FreeBSD port for a nice walkthough
of the changes you'll want to make.
