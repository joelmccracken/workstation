Yes, this is the place. Or you can email me directly, but I prefer to keep
discussions public.

`propellor --spin` needs a way to run commands as root on the remote host.
If ssh as root on OSX is not allowed, it would need a way to get to a user
who can get root, and it would be very annoying if a password needed to be
entered since each `propellor --spin` actually makes several ssh connections to
the remote host. Anything that works within these constraints would be ok.
