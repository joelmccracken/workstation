Sounds good. I contacted the person you linked to, have not heard back yet. 



The first issue I ran into is that propellor wants to connect to \"root@<hostname>\", and it doesn't look like this is configurable.
Would you accept a patch to make this configurable?

Additionally, is this the best place to ask questions about what you would/would not accept?

Thank you!!!
