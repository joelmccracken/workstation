At least on Debian, bind seems to come configured to listen on all
interfaces by default, so I have not messed with listen-on settings at all.

confLines seems to have been included in NamedConf to allow for specifying
additional lines, but there does not seem to be an interface to set it.
Versions of the 3 dns properties with an additional (NamedConf -> NamedConf)
parameter woulld be one way; I'd take such a patch.

As to a minimal config vs a full clone, it's up to you. With a full clone
you can easily modify all of propellor's properties to quicklly deal with
issues like this.. but then you might have to maintain your patches if you
don't get them accepted into propellor.
