I have found a workaround -- Since git pull is broken, it can instead do a
git fetch followed by a git merge. I've put that fix in place.

Unfortunately, --spin can't be used to deploy a fix that breaks the --spin
transport! So, hosts that are suffering from this problem will need to have
their propellor git repos updated in some other way, like pulling from a
central git repo.
