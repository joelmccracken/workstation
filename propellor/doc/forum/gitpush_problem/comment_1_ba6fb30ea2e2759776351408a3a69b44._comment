About all I can tell from this is that "git fetch" is failing, and
apparently complaining about being passed a "gitpush" option. 

Since the only occurrance of "gitpush" is a internal flag that propellor
passes to itself, and not to git fetch, I don't know why your propellor
would be doing this. Perhaps if you turn on `PROPELLOR_DEBUG` you'll find
out more.
