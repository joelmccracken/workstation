Hello I built the debian package of your git repository  with debuild and installed it.

then I run propellor in order to upgrade my local repo

:~/.propellor$ propellor
** warning: ** Your /home/picca/.propellor is out of date..
   A newer upstream version is available in /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git
   To merge it, find the most recent commit in your repository's history that corresponds to an upstream release of propellor, and set refs/remotes/upstream/master to it. Then run propellor again.
   
So I followed the advices, found the most recent commit which was the one created when I run for the first time propellor cb7f1acc108609b345dbec26d8113513bf7b4ece

But now when I run propellor,I get thir message

:~/.propellor$ propellor
** warning: ** Your /home/picca/.propellor is out of date..
   A newer upstream version is available in /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git
   To merge it, run: git merge upstream/master
   

But when I try the merge,

~/.propellor$ git merge upstream/master
Already up-to-date.


so nothing happend
