What's happening here is propellor is running: git pull --progress
--upload-pack command, where command is "./propellor --gitpush".

Apparently git's --upload-pack option parsing has changed in a way that
breaks this. 

I think this is a straight-up git bug. I have reported the bug to the
git mailing list.

May have to work around the bug by just passing "./propellor" to
--upload-pack, and using environment variables to tell it what to do.

Erm.. AFAIKS, git pull is no longer running --upload-pack specified 
command at all. So it seems git has completely defeated how propellor --spin
sends a git push over its ssh channel. I don't have any prospect of a fix
right now.
