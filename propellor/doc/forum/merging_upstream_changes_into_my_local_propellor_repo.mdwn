When there were upstream changes available, propellor used to prompt me to
merge upstream changes into my local propellor repo with:

    git merge upstream/master

Of late, propellor has not been prompting me to merge upstream changes and
my local propellor repo is stuck at ~version 5.3.5

Is there is (another manual) way to merge upstream changes into my local propellor
repo?

My propellor repo is at

    git clone git://git.ricketyspace.net/propellor.git

Note that I've have some minor updates under the `src/` directory. [Some][0] [of][1] [them][2] were
merged into upstream.
