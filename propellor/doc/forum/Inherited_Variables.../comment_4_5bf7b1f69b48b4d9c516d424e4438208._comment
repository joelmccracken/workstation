Ugh, sorry to ask again but I'm specifically stuck trying to extract the Debian suite only from this. Is this stored as a specific value I can draw on? I've been wading through the source and added in a swag of trial and error with no luck.

I can see the suite listed in the output 

    Just (System (Debian Linux (Stable \"jessie\"))

but I was wondering if there was a method to pull out just the suite code name (ie: \"jessie\") that did not involve a regex looking for it amongst that output. 

The goal is to query Info so that a suite name can be added to a sources list.

If I have to regex, that's OK, I just didn't want to go down that path if there was a smarted way.

Thanks Joey :-)
