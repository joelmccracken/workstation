This is where propellor's `Info` system comes in. `Propellor.Info.getOS`
can be run to get the OS info.

It's also possible to add new properties that add new values with custom
types to `Info`.

The hostname is not currently stored in `Info`, but it probably should be;
that would be a good simplification. Currently there's a 
separate way to get the hostname: `asks hostName` (run in the Propellor monad)
