Privdata uses the combination of the Context and the PrivDataField
to identify the piece of private data to use. So, you don't
need to add a new constructor to PrivDataField as long as you can
find a context that is sufficiently specific for your needs.
The gitlab url (without the password) would make a fine context.

So, I'd suggest something like `withPrivData (Password "thegitlaburl") (Context "thegitlaburl")`

See the example in the haddock for withPrivData to for how to use that.

(The only possible problem with that is you're claiming it's a password
when it's really an API key. Propellor won't care, but it you wanted
to store the actual gitlab password too, then you'd need to use a different
username. It may make sense to add a new constructor to PrivDataField for
an API key or something like that.)
