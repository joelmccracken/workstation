Hello joey,

I would like to know your opinion, on the best way to install from scratch a cluster of at least 20 machines all identical, with propellor.
I saw the FAI project, but I am wondering if this can be achieved with propellor only.
The installation should be done remotly without human intervention except the propellor config :) and Indeed power on the cluster :)
