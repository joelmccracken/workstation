I'd also like to use systemd-nspawn with its own network in the container.
Have not worked through all the necessary config, which seems fairly
complicated on the systemd side. Examples of how to do that with propellor
would be great to have! 

(There's a partial example in the haddock for
Systemd.publish, which uses networkd to auto-configure a private network,
but IIRC that is missing some routing/masqerading to let the
container access the internet.)

As for `alias` and `ipv4` properties, when used in a container, their info
does get propagated out to the info of the host as of propellor 4.8.1. 
That was done because it's sometimes useful to have an `alias` be part
of a container's configuration and get the DNS server automatically
configured with that alias pointing at the host(s) that have the container.

I agree it does not make sense for `ipv4`/`ipv6` used in a container
to propagate out. I've changed propellor to not do that any longer,
and allow controlling whether any given DNS info should propagate or not.

As for the hostname, it's not currently part of the Info system,
and so there's no risk of a container overriding its Host's name.
Things like Hostname.sane that look at the hostname will see the parent
host's name. Hostname.setTo should work in a container to give it
its own name. (At some point it would probably be worth moving hostnames
into Info to avoid the extra complication..)
