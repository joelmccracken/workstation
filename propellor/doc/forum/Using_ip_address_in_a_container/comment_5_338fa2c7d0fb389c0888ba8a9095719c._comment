@Nicolas, the reason it appears twice is that resolveConfed is added by
default, and then you added it again reverted. That display could certianly
be improved, perhaps by having it look to see if there's a resolveConfed
setting before adding in the default one.

As to why reverting it didn't work, that was a Info ordering bug, which
I've now fixed.
