I don't think you need to use a different name for your config file, unless
it somehow makes things easier for you.

It's fine to use `Utility.*` like that, but do note that there's no guaranteed 
API stability for those. OTOH, if you might later contribute some
properties built using `Utility.*` back to propellor, it certianly makes
sense to use those.
