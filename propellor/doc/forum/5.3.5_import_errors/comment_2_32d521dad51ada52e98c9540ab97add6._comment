Seems this must be caused by [[!commit d8d2faece72eabd18c2ff303e5fb63c3a69961f6]]

And I guess you've modified the config.hs in propellor
for your own systems?

You will indeed need to add dependencies to the cabal stanza for
propellor-config.

I think that you may be able to add Other-Modules: Utility.FileMode
to the cabal stanza for propellor-config and get access to the unexported
module that way. Not 100% sure.

I'm curious: Is there part of propellor's published modules that made you
need something from Utility.FileMode to use it, or were you writing your
own property and happened to use something from Utility.FileMode?
