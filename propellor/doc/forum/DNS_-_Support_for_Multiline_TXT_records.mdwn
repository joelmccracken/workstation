bind9 has a limit on the number of characters in a single line TXT record. I was unable to provision the DKIM TXT record using propellor due to this limit.

I added a new MTXT record type to `Propellor.Types.DNS.Record` ([patch][1]).

MTXT creates a multiline TXT record. It splits the record's text (say
"long string...\n...xyz") at `'\n'` and creates a TXT record of the
form:


    domain IN      TXT     ( "long string..."
            "...xyz" )


I'm [currently using this recipe][2] to provision the DKIM TXT record.

I want to know if there is a better way to do this without having to add the MTXT record type?
