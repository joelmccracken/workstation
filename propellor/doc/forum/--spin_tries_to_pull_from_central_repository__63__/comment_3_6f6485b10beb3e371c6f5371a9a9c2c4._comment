I have a similar problem with inaccessible central repo. This crash is still biting me when spinning from a Debian stable (stretch) host to itself.
I could potentially make the central repo accessible via adding a key, but I think the pull is too early in the process for that work out. Any other ideas? Can I just turn off this pull for some hosts?
