I'm using the `Locale.available` property, and it seems the locales are always generated:

```
Generating locales (this might take a while)...
  en_GB.UTF-8... done
  en_US.UTF-8... done
  en_ZA.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
onyx.fusionapp.com en_ZA.UTF-8 locale generated ... done
Generating locales (this might take a while)...
  en_GB.UTF-8... done
  en_US.UTF-8... done
  en_ZA.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
onyx.fusionapp.com en_US.UTF-8 locale generated ... done
```

I inspected the definition of the property, but I'm not sure where the bug is. Should `fileProperty` with identical contents be causing `onChange` to trigger?
