can spin to softland, my sid+experimental host now.

with recent git://propellor.branchable.com/ updates
and have used:

```
  & os (System (Debian Experimental) \"amd64\")
```

so sorry for the noise, still not sure about:

* how to express my installation properly:
  mostly unstable, ghc stuff from experimental

* how to turn off the git push to branchable attempts
  when just spinning to one of my mashines:
  have set now:
    ``` 
    git branch --unset-upstream
    ``` 
 which shortcuts these attempts at least.
