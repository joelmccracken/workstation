Pushing to origin is needed when using propellor in the central git
repository deployment mode. So it makes sense for --spin to try to push.
If that push fails for some reason, it's not a fatal error, since propellor
--spin also does peer-to-peer pushes.

I don't think I want to get into trying to determine if a particular origin
repo url is read-only or read-write. It can be hard to tell with eg
a https url.

Why don't you just `git remote rename origin upstream`? If the remote
is not called origin, propellor will ignore it.
