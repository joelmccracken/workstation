@mithrandi there are ways to make ghc type error messages arbitrarily long,
and IIRC that causes the memory to blow up.

I'm mostly interested in memory blowups when building a valid
configuration, since those cause problems to the hosts propellor is
deployed to, rather than just to the system where it's developed.
