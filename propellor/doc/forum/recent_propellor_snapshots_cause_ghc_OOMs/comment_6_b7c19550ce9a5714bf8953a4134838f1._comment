My config.hs is here:
https://git.mcwhirter.io/snippets/1

I've added my propellor.cabal as there may be value in that:
https://git.mcwhirter.io/snippets/2

I do have my own modules. Disabling them was one of my first steps. This should now be only using shipped Propellor modules.

I'm interested in seeing your thoughts.

Thanks Joey.
