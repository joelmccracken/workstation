I'm experiencing this quite badly. GHC will consume all 8G RAM before locking the machine up (if I don't catch it first).

-O0 was already in propellor.cabal:

GHC-Options: -threaded -Wall -fno-warn-tabs -O0  

I have set PROPELLOR_DEBUG=1

Strace isn't turning up anything that I can use.

I'm not getting a anything useful to track down the source of this problem for me. 

Any tips on what I can do to track this down?

Thanks!
