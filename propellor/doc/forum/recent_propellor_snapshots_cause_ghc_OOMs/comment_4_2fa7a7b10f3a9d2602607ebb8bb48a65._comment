Thanks for getting back to me Joey. BTW a friend of mine (Fractalcat | Sharif) met you at ICFP where you claimed I was your fourth user of propellor ;-)

I'm not sure which source you're specifically after and my propellor repo is not yet public. Perhaps now's the time to do that :-)

Here's where it's getting stuck in the propellor --spin cycle, this last one ran for 3 hours consuming most RAM and swap before I killed it:

compile: input file src/config.hs
*** Checking old interface for Main:
[89 of 89] Compiling Main             ( src/config.hs, dist/build/propellor-config/propellor-config-tmp/Main.o )
*** Parser:

My GHC flags in propellor.cabal are:

    time, mtl, transformers, exceptions (>= 0.6), stm, text

Some googling made me think my custom types were causing this and they needed to be upgraded so I commented out all my custom types but this did not help.

I'm happy to paste up my source when I know which files you need.

Thanks!
