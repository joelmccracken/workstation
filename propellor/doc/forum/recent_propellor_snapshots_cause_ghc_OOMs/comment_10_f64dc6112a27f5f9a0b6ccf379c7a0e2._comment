Mistakes in the parameters of properties (leaving out a parameter, wrong type
parameter, etc) don't cause these super-long error messages, even when the
property is in the middle of a big block of other properties. 

The problem occurs only when a lot of properties have
been combined together using `&` and used in an ill-typed way; in this situation
ghc can't infer the a simple type for the combined properties, due to the use
of type level functions to combine them.

So, at least in this case, it doesn't seem to be a problem users are likely
to hit except during the propellor 3.0 ugrade or if they forget to use
`props` at some other time.
