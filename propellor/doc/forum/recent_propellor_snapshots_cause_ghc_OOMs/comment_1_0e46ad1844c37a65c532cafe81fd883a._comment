The enhanced property types in propellor 3.0 are known to have made ghc use
more memory when building it. Building with -O0 helped a lot for me, and
it's doing ok on a 500 mb memory machine. So I recommend -O0 in your cabal
file if you don't have that already.

I wrote down my memory benchmarks here:
