That all makes sense. Thanks joey.

The update to Propellor 3.x caught me by surprise and this all resulted from that. Clearly I need to watch Propellor blog posts more more carefully :-)

I'll take your example, read the upgrading doco and get things going from there, now the I understand the problem.

I'll pass on those modules when the move beyond \"embarrassingly incomplete\" and become something that I think other people can use :-D
