Hi there,

I've been tasked with investigating propellor as an alternative to Ansible. I'm a little bit confused about how one might go about managing a *single* project's hosts with propellor, without infecting the global propellor config. It seems that everything is concerned with the ~/.propellor repository. However, I don't want project A's hosts to know about project B's and vice versa. I'm sure I'm overlooking something obvious!

Thanks very much!

Mitchell
