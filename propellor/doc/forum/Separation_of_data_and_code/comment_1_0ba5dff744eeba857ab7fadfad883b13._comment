I was going to write something asserting that it's entirely data,
and not code, though typed data expressed in a programming language.

However, I think it's better to say that this code/data distinction is
much less a useful distinction that commonly thought, one that things,
especially in the configuration management space often chafe under (see
all the turing complete ill-specified languages built on top of what
started out as some pure data format that are in use by almost every other
configuration management tool), and that Propellor is an attempt to
move in a more useful and less ridigly defined direction.
