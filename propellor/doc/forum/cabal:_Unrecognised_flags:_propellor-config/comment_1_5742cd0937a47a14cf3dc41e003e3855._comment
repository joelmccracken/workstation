propellor-config is the name of the Executable component
in the cabal file that we want cabal to build.

	Usage: cabal build [FLAGS]
	   or: cabal build COMPONENTS [FLAGS]

It's the COMPONENT shown in the cabal build help. It seems that your cabal
doesn't not understand this syntax. What version of cabal is that?

(Based on the license warning, I'm guessing its an older version of cabal
than the 1.22.6.0 I'm using here. The cabal 1.20.0.3 in Debian stable also
supports this syntax.)

Only building the propellor-config Executable is only an optimisation;
otherwise cabal build also builds propellor as a library which is not
needed here. So your workaround to drop that parameter should be ok.

You probably need to rebuild propellor on the remote host manually
after updating the code there, since the remote host has a version of
propellor compiled such that it tries to recompile itself using that parameter..
