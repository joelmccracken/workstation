Local (Debian \"Stretch\"):

    % cabal -V    
    cabal-install version 1.22.9.0
    using version 1.22.8.0 of the Cabal library

Remote (Buntish 14.04):

    # cabal -V
    cabal-install version 1.16.0.2
    using version 1.16.0 of the Cabal library

This host needs to remain 14.04 for reasons out of my control.

When I land in a few hours, I'll try upgrading cabal on that host and I expect the problem will disappear.

Thanks!

(kicking myself for not thinking of cabal versions)
