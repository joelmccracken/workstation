I think that the point of this was to prevent people with 'stable' in their sources.list from accidentally upgrading to a new stable release.  Similarly, to prevent users with 'testing' in their sources.list from upgrading to the new testing, when what they wanted to do was track stable+1.

I think that when a user uses propellor's `Testing` and `Unstable` types they are explicitly requesting a rolling release, so it seems find to pass it for those suites.

This is not based on reading any discussions about the new feature.  Just my own inference as to its purpose.
