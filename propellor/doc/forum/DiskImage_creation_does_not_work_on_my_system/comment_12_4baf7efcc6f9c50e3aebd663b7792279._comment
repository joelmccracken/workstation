If I understand correctly, the new typeclass need to provide a method which return the
(RawDiskImage filename). In the process we have at least 2 cache level
One for the chroot, and one for the RawImage.

I was wondering if these cache (side effect) could not be regrouped
under /var/cache/propellor instead of putting this randomly everywhere on the disk.

This way It should be possible to \"reset\" propellor by removing the cache in order to force
a cache rebuild.

I think about this because I am not aware as a user of all these \"side effects\".

propellor --purge-cache ;)

cheers and thanks again
