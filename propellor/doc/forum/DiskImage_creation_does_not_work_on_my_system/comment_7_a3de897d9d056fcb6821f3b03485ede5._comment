The vmdk text file is so small that I did think about just having propellor
generate it by itself. I don't know how stable/documented it is however.

I suppose that if you're distributing a vmdk image to others, you would not
want to use the text file format, since that hard-codes the path to the
.img file. So, perhaps there should be separate properties for vmdk text
files that point at disk images and self-contained vmdk images.
