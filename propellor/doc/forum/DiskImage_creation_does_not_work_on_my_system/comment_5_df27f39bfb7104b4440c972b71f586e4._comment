The `vmdkBuiltFor` property is provided to make a disk image
usable with virtualbox. If your distribution chooses not to include
virtualbox and so you don't have virtualbox installed, what good would
such an image be to you?

To use `vmdkBuiltFor` you must already have a disk image file, which qemu
etc can already use.

"qemu-img convert" writes a whole disk image file. This is a much more
expensive operation than what `vmdkBuiltFor` currently does, which creates
a tiny text file that makes virtualbox use the existing disk image.
