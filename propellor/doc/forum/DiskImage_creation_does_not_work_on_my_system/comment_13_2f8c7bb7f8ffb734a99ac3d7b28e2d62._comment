Yes, there are two levels of caches. This does make updating the images a
whole lot faster!

Some systems don't have a very large /var partition and so I think it's
better to let the user pick where they go. The documentation could
certainly (always) be improved.

Note that reverting any of the properties in DiskImage will clean up
all the cache files as well as the final disk image.
