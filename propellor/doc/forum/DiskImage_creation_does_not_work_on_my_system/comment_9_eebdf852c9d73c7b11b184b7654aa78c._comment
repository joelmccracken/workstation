The `DiskImage` data type could be expanded to support different output
formats.

Or, a type class could be used, so eg:

	imageBuilt :: DiskImage d => d -> (FilePath -> Chroot) -> TableType -> [PartSpec ()] -> RevertableProperty (HasInfo + DebianLike) Linux

The type class would just need a function to convert from the raw disk
image to the desired file format. Then anyone could add whatever disk image
formats they want (which can probably shade into containers in some cases).
