It is true that my uszer prefer the embeded virtual image :).

Maybe we could have a DiskImage export property which could take an output format type
I do not know how many format are out there for these kind of virtual machines.
Maybe this could be also a way to prepare images for the cloud. (I do not use this mayself but why not).
What is the difference between Diskimage and containers ?

Cheers

Frederic
