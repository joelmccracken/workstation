Hello,

I am creating virtual machines and set the url of propellor with 

    & PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl "https://salsa.debian.org/picca/propellor.git"

I give the old name since I use the 5.6.0 version available in Debian stable.

It systematically fail each time I provision the machine.
I discovered that it failed due to a missing git.

so it seems to me that this property should install git  before running :)

cheers
