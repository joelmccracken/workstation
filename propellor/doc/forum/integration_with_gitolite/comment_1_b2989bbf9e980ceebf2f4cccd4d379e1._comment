Probably the sane way is to [not use the gitolite-admin repo](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/odds-and-ends/#administering-gitolite-directly-on-the-server). Aside from being unfamiliar, that means I have to deal with a bunch small config files (say 50 - 100) in propellor. So far I'm not loving the idea of converting them all to Haskell, even with a script. But maybe I'll come around to it.
