Hello Joey

with 2.17.2 I get this. (there is nevertheless a progression in the right direction :p)

    [2016-04-01 07:42:02 CEST] process done ExitSuccess

    You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these.
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     g++-5 : Depends: gcc-5-base (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
     gcc-5 : Depends: cpp-5 (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
             Depends: gcc-5-base (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
     libgcc-5-dev : Depends: gcc-5-base (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
     libstdc++-5-dev : Depends: gcc-5-base (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
     libstdc++6 : Depends: gcc-5-base (= 5.3.1-7) but 5.3.1-8 is installed
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild apt update ... failed
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild apt cache cleaned ... ok
    mordor chroot /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild provisioned ... failed
    mordor replace /etc/schroot/chroot.d/unstable-i386-sbuild ... failed

so now the  proposition is to run `apt -f install`
So what is the right way to solve this  (I hope) last issue during chroot upgrade?
