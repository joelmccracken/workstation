       -f, --fix-broken
           Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies
           in place. This option, when used with install/remove, can
           omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely
           solution. If packages are specified, these have to
           completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes
           necessary when running APT for the first time; APT itself
           does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a
           system.

So I don't see how you could get into this situation unless perhaps
your debootstrap configuration gets into a broken dependency situation somehow.

IIRC, apt-get -f install can decide to *remove* arbitrary packages as necessary
to get to a sane dependency tree. So I'm very dubious about doing it by default.
