There are several ways this could happen, along the lines of a power
failure or ctrl-c at the wrong time. A failing postinst may also cause
apt to leave other packages un-configured, although `dpkg configure -a`
probably won't recover from that case.

I think it makes sense for Apt.upgrade to run `dpkg --configure -a`
in case the last upgrade got into this state. I don't think it makes sense
for Apt.install to do that (too much overhead to do it every time,
and I don't think that unconfigured packages normally prevent installing
of an unrelated package anyway). I've made a change along these lines.
