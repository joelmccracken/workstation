Inspirated by <http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/custom_ARM_disk_image_generation_with_propellor/>
I started to teach propellor about other ARM boards.
(After having a clean build for a supported ARM board)


Using two directories, a `~/.propellor` with my hosts and `src/propellor` with propellor source code.

In the code directory I modified `src/Propellor/Property/Machine.hs`,
compiled with `debuild -uc -us` and installed with `dpkg -i ../propellor*.deb`.

Then using my hosts directory to get a WTF moment

	$ propellor --spin paddy.gpm.stappers.nl
	Auto-merging src/Propellor/Property/Machine.hs
	Auto-merging propellor.cabal
	Auto-merging debian/changelog
	Auto-merging config.hs
	CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in config.hs
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
	propellor: Failed to run git ["merge","279b9267952b598914037983f74606d4f9c4ff6e","-s",

		,"--allow-unrelated-histories"]
	CallStack (from HasCallStack):
	  error, called at src/Propellor/DotDir.hs:425:17 in main:Propellor.DotDir


What did connect both directories and why?


More important:

What directory setup and workflow to use
to teach propellor about other ARM boards?
