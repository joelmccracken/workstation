Hello,

while  running propellor on a brand new  installed machine.
I got this error message


    [master 4c06fcd] propellor spin
     1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
    Git commit ... done
    Password for 'https://picca@salsa.debian.org': 
    To https://salsa.debian.org/picca/propellor.git
       d8cfab0..4c06fcd  master -> master
    Push to central git repository ... done
    propellor: /home/picca/.ssh/propellor: createDirectory: does not exist (No such file or directory)


so it seems that propellor does not create the .ssh directory if it does not exists.

cheers

Frederic
