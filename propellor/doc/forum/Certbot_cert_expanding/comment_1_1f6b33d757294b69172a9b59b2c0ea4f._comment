Makes sense. The man page says:

            --expand              If an existing certificate is a strict subset of the
                                  requested names, always expand and replace it with the
                                  additional names. (default: Ask)

Which reads like it will not change behavior in other cases. 
Still, it would be good for someone to test it before the change is
made to propellor..
