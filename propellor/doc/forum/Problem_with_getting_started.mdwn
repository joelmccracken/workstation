Hello, I hope this is the right place to ask for help.

I am new to Haskell and Propellor; just want to give it a try. I have been using ansible but now looking for an alternative.

I did the following steps:

* install propellor on control machine with: `stack install propellor`

* `propellor --init`

* create a minimal config.hs file, which does nothing:

        abc :: Host
        abc = host "abc" $ props
            & osDebian (Stable "stretch") X86_64


when I run `propellor --spin abc`, it ended with the following message:

    .
    .
    Installed propellor-5.3.4
    Resolving dependencies...
    Configuring config-0...
    Preprocessing executable 'propellor-config' for config-0...
    cabal: can't find source for config in .
    sh: 1: ./propellor: not found
    propellor: user error (ssh <long text>

Can someone give me a hint how to process further?

Regards,
Tony
