Thank you for this excellent idea and post! I've added a link to it under
the quick start on the front page.

Propellor's deployment system
is just what happened to meet my needs, but certianly not ideal for anyone,
and what I really like about this is it shows how the core of propellor is
not locked into that one system.

I see that `entr` automatically re-transfers the file when it has changed,
so am I right that you could use this in combination with eg 
`stack build --file-watch` to immediately test each change to config.hs?

Do note that your method doesn't transfer over any private data that
propellor might use on the host. And, some container properties need
the propellor binary in /usr/local/propellor/ in order to work. 
But until you need such properties, it's a nice way to get your feet wet.
