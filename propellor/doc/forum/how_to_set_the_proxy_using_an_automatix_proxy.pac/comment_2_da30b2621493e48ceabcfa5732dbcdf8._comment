In my case I need to wget the proxy.pac file and parse it to find the right proxy.

what worried me is that these proxy.pac things are dynamical depending on the ip of the sender AND the receive.
It work nicely with web browser, but not with the unix http_proxy and HTTPS_PROXY env.

nevertheless, I can create something to parse my local setup and extract the right http_proxy.

Is there something available in Propellor to set a global environment variable in /etc/environment (the right place for this ?)

cheers

Frederic
