[@spwhitton](https://propellor.branchable.com/user/spwhitton/), My current host machine is OpenBSD. So, I get propellor from `cabal`.

Currently I've propellor 5.8.0 installed from cabal.

My local propellor repo is itself is stuck at 5.3.5 (<https://git.ricketyspace.net/propellor/files.html>).

I wanted to know if there was a way to manually merge upstream changes into my local propellor repo?
