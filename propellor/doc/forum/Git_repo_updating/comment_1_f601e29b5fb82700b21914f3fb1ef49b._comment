You could certianly write a property that did a git pull every time. It
would do some unnessesary work and still not keep the checkout always
immediately up-to-date.

Better to have some kind of hook that causes the checkout to update when
changes are pushed into its parent repository. How such a hook works
depends on where the parent repository is hosted. Propellor properties
could be written to set up whatever's needed for such a hook on the system
where the repository is checked out. If you're hosting your own git
server as well, propellor properties could set up the post-update hook in
the origin repo too.
