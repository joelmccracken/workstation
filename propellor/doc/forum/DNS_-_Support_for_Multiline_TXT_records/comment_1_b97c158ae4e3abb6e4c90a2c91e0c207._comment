It seems that the limit is 255 characters, and this
limit applies to any string in a bind zone file,
rather than being a maximim line length. A single line can contain multiple
such strings, although there's probably a maximum line length somewhere 
too, so using parens to extend across multiple lines is wise.

The values inside the parens are concacenated together, no newline is added
to the string that bind builds up from them AFAICS.

So it seems your code is stripping out the newlines from the TXT value.
Which probably doesn't matter for DKIM public key material,
and I don't think that bind zone files support multiline strings anyway.
But a single line could be too long and splitting on newlines would not
help then.

So, I think the thing to do would be to make `rValue` break TXT
strings into substrings no longer than 255 characters. Then you don't
need a new constructor, and long SSHFP etc records could also be handled
that way.
