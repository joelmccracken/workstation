ok so it seems that propellor-config is empty ??? for the bad version.

Now I understand better why nothing happened :)
So maybe the power outrage was done during the compilation of the propellor-config executable.
Maybe something can be done in order to avoid producing this empty file.
Maybe just keep the old version of propellor-config until the new propellor-config is ready to replace it.
