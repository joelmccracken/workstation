So here's the code that runs that ssh command:

	unlessM (boolSystem "ssh" (map Param $ cacheparams ++ ["-t", sshtarget, shellWrap runcmd])) $
		error "remote propellor failed"

I'm surprised it didn't fail with the error. This seems to say that ssh
exited 0, but without running the command.

Also, ssh seems to have decided to take down the shared connection of its
own accord, which seems strange. Normally it should leave the shared
connection open.

If you're able to reproduce this reliably, look into whether making
`sshCachingParams` return [] and thus get rid of this ssh connection caching somehow avoids the problem?
