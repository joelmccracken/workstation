Propellor uses a shared ssh connection to the remote host to avoid
the overhead of multiple ssh connections. ssh will sometimes say "shared
connection ... closed" when taking down such a connection. 

Propellor only reuses such a shared connection for up to 10 minutes; it it
finds an old one (perhaps from a previous run of propellor), it will ask
ssh to close the old connection.

I don't think it's anything to worry about unless propellor is failing to
work for some reason.
