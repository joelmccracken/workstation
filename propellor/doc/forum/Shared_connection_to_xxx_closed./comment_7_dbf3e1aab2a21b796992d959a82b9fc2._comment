Ah, that makes much more sense; rather than a strange ssh problem,
propellor is apparently exiting 0 w/o doing anything when run 
with `./propellor --continue 'SimpleRun "xxx"'` or something close to that.

So, this might have to do with the old propellor not supporting SimpleRun,
which was added back in 0.4.0.

Or, more likely, it's broken in some way that makes it not do anything when
asked to so a SimpleRun for a particular host.

You can probably try running the old propellor with that SimpleRun parameter and
the command line and get a better feel for what it's doing, and if desired,
bisect or otherwise instrument the program to see why it behaved this way.
