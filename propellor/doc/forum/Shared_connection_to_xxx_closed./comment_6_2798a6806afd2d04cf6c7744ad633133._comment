I did the test without the cache system and it was not better (same error message).
Then I removed /usr/local/propellor and run propellor from scratch-> it worked :)

So now I have a working propellor directory and a non working one.
I checked that putting back the old /usr/local/propellor cause the same trouble.

If you want I can send you in private both version of the directory.
