Yeah, if someone wants to check out origin/precompiled and test if it
works, it may well be in a mergeable state. However, it doesn't deal with
cross compilation to arm or anything like that.

Anyway, once you've built a propellor binary, all it takes to run it on
some remote host is "sudo ./propellor" (perhaps passing the hostname
to run for if the current hostname is not one that propellor recognises). 

But it expects to be run in a clone of the git repository, I don't know
what will fail if it's run without that clone. Probably best to clone the
git repo to /usr/local/propellor and run it in there.

And if any of your properties rely on private data
it won't be able to access that and they'll fail.
