Thanks for your responses! I wasn't aware there was prior work done on this.

`origin/precompiled` did not build for me. But when I merged master into it, and patching around a trivial merge conflict, I got this:

```
[ 58 of 182] Compiling Propellor.Property ( src/Propellor/Property.hs, dist/build/Propellor/Property.o )

src/Propellor/Property.hs:364:13: error:
    * Could not deduce (Monoid (Property (MetaTypes t)))
        arising from a use of `mempty'
      from the context: SingI t
        bound by the type signature for:
                   doNothing :: forall k (t :: k). SingI t => Property (MetaTypes t)
        at src/Propellor/Property.hs:363:1-46
    * In the expression: mempty
      In an equation for `doNothing': doNothing = mempty
    |
364 | doNothing = mempty
    |             ^^^^^^
```

Unfortunately, I am not versed enough in Haskell to understand the error.


```
$ ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.4
```

Here is my merged fork (based on 38b4da93 and origin/precompiled at 7d550c75): if you can `make` it: [github.com/motiejus/propellor](https://github.com/motiejus/propellor), and tell me how to fix the above error, I would try to test it functionally further.
