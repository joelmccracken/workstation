Funny, I never considered that the Firewall properties don't do anything
persistent.

I don't think we want to get propellor involved in booting the system,
either..

Using iptables-save seems to have a problem: If there are other iptables
rules that were not set by this run of propellor, it will save those
as well. So it could save rules that were set up by something else that was
intended to be temporary, or perhaps rules that were set by a earlier
propellor config and that then got deleted out of the propellor config.

Another way to do it could be to have Firewall.rule add its configuration
to Info and then Firewall.save could see the collected Info from all
the rules and use it to generate the boot script itself.
