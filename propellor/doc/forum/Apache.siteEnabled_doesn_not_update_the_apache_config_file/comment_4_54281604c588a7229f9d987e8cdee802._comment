Pretty obvious why if you look at the code:

	enable = check (not <$> isenabled) $
		cmdProperty "a2ensite" ["--quiet", hn]
			`describe` ("apache site enabled " ++ hn)
			`requires` siteAvailable hn cf

So that property was skipped entirely if the site was already enabled and never looked at the config file.

I've put in a fix.
