Well, `backportSuite` takes a `DebianSuite` data type, and `Stable`
is a constructor for it. So, you don't quote the data constructor,
but only quote the release name string passed to it:

	(Stable "jessie")

But, `backportSuite` is not a property, so you can't add it to a host
with `&` anyway.

If you're trying to set up a sources.list that can install backports, the
way to do it is:

	& osDebian (Stable "jessie") "amd64"
	& Apt.stdSourcesList

The standard sources.list configuration includes backports when
the `DebianSuite` part of the host's OS is a stable release.

There's also a property to install packages from backports:

	& Apt.installedBackport ["somepackage"]
