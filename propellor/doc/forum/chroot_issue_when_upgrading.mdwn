Hello,

It seems that my unstable chroot is broken.
When I do an upgrade, I get this error message


    E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. 
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild has Operating System (Debian Unstable) "i386" ... ok
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild noop property ... ok
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild apt installed apt-transport-https ... ok
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild standard sources.list ... ok
    Hit:1 http://ftp2.fr.debian.org/debian unstable InRelease
    Hit:2 http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian unstable InRelease
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild apt update ... failed
    /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild apt cache cleaned ... ok
    mordor chroot /srv/chroot/unstable-i386-sbuild provisioned ... failed

the properties are here
    sbuild :: System -> Proxy -> RevertableProperty HasInfo
    sbuild system proxy = Sbuild.schroot schrootname chroot
      where
        chroot = Chroot.debootstrapped Debootstrap.BuilddD chrootdir
                 & os system
                 & case proxy of
                      (Just p) -> "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy" `File.hasContent` ["Acquire::http::Proxy \"" ++ p ++ "\";"]
                      Nothing -> doNothing
                 & Apt.installed ["apt-transport-https"]
                 & Apt.stdSourcesList
                 & Apt.update `onChange` Apt.upgrade
                 & Apt.cacheCleaned
        schrootname = Sbuild.schrootname system
        chrootdir = "/srv/chroot" </> schrootname

so the update failed and the solution seems to be

    dpkg --configure -a

Is it possible to deal with this problem in the update property in order to make it transparent for the users.

Cheers

Frederic
