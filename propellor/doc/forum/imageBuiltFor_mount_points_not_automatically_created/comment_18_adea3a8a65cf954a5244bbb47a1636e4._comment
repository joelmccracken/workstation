I don't know much about GPT boot stuff. I found mention of a BIOS boot
partition for GPT here:

<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace>

So, 1 mb partition with no filesystem and a "bios_grub" flag.

Propellor's partitioning DSL will need to be extended in order to
support that. Currently, `Partition` has a `Fs` that is one of the common
filesystems or swap. Now we need no filesystem, so either add a NoFs to Fs,
or change it to use `Maybe Fs`. I chose the latter, because with NoFs,
Partition.formatted would be a no-op, which would be kinda surprising.

I've made a commit adding all the stuff you should need, but I have not
tested making a BIOS boot partition with it. Should look
something like this:

	& hasPartition (rawPartition (MegaBytes 1) `setFlag` BiosGrubFlag)

If you get it working, it would be good to add an example to propellor's docs.
