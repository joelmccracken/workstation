Ouch, that does not seem like it was easy to debug... Thanks for looking into this!

    src/Propellor/Property/Parted.hs:114:27: warning: [-Wtype-defaults]
        • Defaulting the following constraints to type ‘Double’
            (Show a0)
              arising from a use of ‘show’
              at src/Propellor/Property/Parted.hs:114:27-57
            (Fractional a0)
              arising from a use of ‘/’
              at src/Propellor/Property/Parted.hs:114:33-56
            (Num a0)
              arising from a use of ‘fromIntegral’
              at src/Propellor/Property/Parted.hs:114:33-46
        • In the first argument of ‘(++)’, namely
            ‘show (fromIntegral n / 1000000)’
          In the expression: show (fromIntegral n / 1000000) ++ \"MB\"
          In an equation for ‘partposfuzzy’:
              partposfuzzy n
                | n > 0 = show (fromIntegral n / 1000000) ++ \"MB\"
                | otherwise = \"1MB\"

I now get:

    mount: /tmp/mntzZ3vjF: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/loop0p2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
    umount: /tmp/mntzZ3vjF: not mounted.
    ** fatal error: failed unmounting /tmp/mntzZ3vjF
    propellor: StopPropellorException \"Cannot continue!\"

:(. I'll try to reboot, I don't get how to remove/unmount this /dev/mapper/loop0p2 (I tried \"dmsetup remove\", \"losetup -d\" without success...)
