I tried several configurations, without success. Without a serial console, that was not fun to debug... I finally tried to boot the image with qemu, and that worked! So I thought that maybe I should try to use a MSDOS partition table instead of a GPT one, just to be sure. And that finally produced a bootable image on that damn card! :) I'll report a bug to PCEngines. It's unfortunate I can't test the GPT code more, but it would probably work, as it booted in qemu.

Thanks a lot Joey!
