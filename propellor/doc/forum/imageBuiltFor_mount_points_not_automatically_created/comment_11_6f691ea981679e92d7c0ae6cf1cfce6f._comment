So, I rebooted, but I still had the /dev/mapper/loop problem. I was able to \"dmsetup remove\" these, though...

I deleted router.img and router.img.parttable...

    creating /srv/router.img of size 1.66 gigabytes
    loop deleted : /dev/loop0

...and I'm back to the grub-install/grub-update problem, which seems to apply to grub-efi-amd64. It's weird, because it's the version I have on my laptop, and I did not notice this issue (but I installed debian on it a long time ago, so, the bug may have appeared since then).
