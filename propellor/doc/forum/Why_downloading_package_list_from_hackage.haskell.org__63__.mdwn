When running

    propellor --spin newhost

I get (after installing gnupg, ghc, libghc-*, make)

    ....
    Downloading the latest package list from hackage.haskell.org
    Killed
    Killed
    Killed

maybe there is not enough memory, or propellor has a kind of timeout somewhere (newhost is a slow arm router), but I don't understand why propellor (cabal) needs this package list.
