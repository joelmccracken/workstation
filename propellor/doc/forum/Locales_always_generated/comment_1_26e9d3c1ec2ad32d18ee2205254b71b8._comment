What seems to be going on is, /etc/locale.gen is changed, uncommenting
the line, but then the dpkg-reconfigure locales rewrites the file
with the same set of locales enabled but a different set of lines and
comments. So, next time the property runs, it wants to change the file again.

I changed it to run locale-gen instead, which avoids the problem.
