Does anyone have any experience with integrating propellor and gitolite? I'd be happy with just ssh pubkey management.
There seem to be two main options. The typical way of managing a gitolite site is by pushing a special git repository "gitolite-admin". There are also a script called [ukm](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/ukm.html). I'm not sure what will be the least hassle. Currently I have to manually commit and push various keys (including the keys needed for access to the propellor repos). Part of the problem could be solved by making the propellor repos available anonymously, but I still have my own ssh key(s) to manage.
