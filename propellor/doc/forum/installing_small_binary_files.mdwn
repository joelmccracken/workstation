I need to install a small firmware file (it's actually free software, but I need it to boot the emulator I could build it with). I could of course make a debian package and put that package in a repo, but that seems like a lot of fuss for a 32k file. OTOH, I'm a bit loathe to use PrivData for this. Anyone care to either suggest a better way, or convince me it's fine to store firmware in PrivData?
