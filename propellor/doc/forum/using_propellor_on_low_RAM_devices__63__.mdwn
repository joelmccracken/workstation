I'm trying to use propellor (and to learn haskell!) to manage my laptop and a small server, both running debian stable. 

The server is a lime2 soc [1], with only 1GiB of RAM, and no swap (I think this is the default setup from the freedombox image).

propellor --spin failed when targeting the server: on the server, ghc got killed by the OOM killer.

I then simplified my config.hs and successfully ran "cabal build -j1" from the server.
At some point during the successful build, ghc was using 400MiB of memory.
This is 40% of the whole memory, I fear the OOM killer will strike again if I don't change something.
I'll probably try to enable swap.

Propellor seems designed with embedded devices in mind (eg. with the image builder), I'm surprised it demands that much RAM.
Am I missing something?
Do people cross-compile propellor to avoid the issue?

Cheers!
