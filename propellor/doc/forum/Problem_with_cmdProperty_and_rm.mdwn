I am using this property in order to remove a bunch of file

    cmdProperty "rm" ["-f", "-v", "/etc/schroot/chroot.d" </> (chrootname ++ "-sbuild-*")]

during the process it is ok

    xxx@xxxx rm -f -v /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-* ... done

but

    ~$ ls /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-*
    /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-0ClOnm  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-fAxdL6  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-PG9d8D  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-tweTLd
    /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-1qXV4i  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-hLZtEV  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-thaExp  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-uJHP6m
    /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-6wSjGH  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-KNUVIo  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-tUcBcL  /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie-i386-sbuild-UnfRTK

So it seems that this property did not worked.

So I ran propellor with PROPELLOR_DEBUG=1 and the return code of the rm command is a Success

When I use a scriptProperty  it works

    scriptProperty
            [ "rm -f -v " ++ "/etc/schroot/chroot.d" </> (chrootname ++ "-sbuild-*") ]

So it seems that something is wrong with the cmdProperty
