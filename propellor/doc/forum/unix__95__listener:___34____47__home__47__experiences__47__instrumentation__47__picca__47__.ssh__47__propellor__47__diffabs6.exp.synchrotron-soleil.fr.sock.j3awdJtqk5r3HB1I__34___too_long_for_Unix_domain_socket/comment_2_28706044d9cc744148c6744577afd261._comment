If someone wants to improve this more later, it would suffice to make
`sshCachingParams` fall back to using a temp file in /tmp for the socket
when HOME is too long, as long as repeated calls to `sshCachingParams`
inside the same propellor process returned the same temp file each time
(for a given HostName). Of course, the temp files would need to be cleaned
up when propellor exists.
