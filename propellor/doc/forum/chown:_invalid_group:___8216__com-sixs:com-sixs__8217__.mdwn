Hello Joey

I try to use

    Ssh.authorizedKey (User "com-sixs") sshKeyPubComSixs

on a system where the account are available in a ldap.
On this system the group is different from the user name
name -> grp-name

So I end up with this error message

    chown: invalid group: ‘com-sixs:com-sixs’
    sixs3.exp.synchrotron-soleil.fr com-sixs has authorized_keys ... failed

so my questions are.

- Is it mandatory to have a user and the identical group on a unix system ?
- Can we add a Group parameter to the authorizedKey property ?

thanks for your help

Fred
