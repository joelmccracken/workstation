OK, I belatedly see what you mean. It's not relevant if the remote privdata.gpg blob matches or not, since iiuc, only the local one is used by --spin.

I'm having a similar issue with `Property.Gpg.keyImported`.

[[!format text \"\"\"

\"\"\"]]

Of course I did what propellor suggests, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.  Is it possible gpg armoured text is being treated specially as privdata?
