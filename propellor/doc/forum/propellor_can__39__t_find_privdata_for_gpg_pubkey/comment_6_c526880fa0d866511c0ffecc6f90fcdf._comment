I confirmed that privdata is being transmitted, but that my test file is not. The resulting `/usr/local/propellor/privdata/local` file is not obviously corrupted, but does not contain the string \"/root/foo\". The file \"/root/foo\" also does not show as used anywhere in the output of `propellor --list-fields`. I'm not sure if that is surprising or not.
