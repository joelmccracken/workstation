I narrowed it down to the call to Grub.mkConfig, which basically calls \"update-grub\". If I just copy the ConfFile.containsShellSetting from Grub.configured, then things work fine, presumably because of some later call to update-grub (when the image is finalized?).  I'm just guessing, but maybe something later sets up /boot so that update-grub can succeed. I noticed the the call to mkConfig in Grub.installed is guarded against being in a contained, so maybe Grub.configured needs something similar.
