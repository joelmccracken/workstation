There was another error before the error reported above. It was

	Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:
	
	In the dependencies for secret-project-0.0:
	    threepenny-gui-0.7.0.1 from stack configuration does not match (==0.8.0.0) (latest matching version
	                           is 0.8.0.0)
	needed since secret-project is a build target.

My workaround was

	--- a/secret-project.cabal
	+++ b/secret-project.cabal
	@@ -21,7 +21,7 @@ Executable propellor-config
	   Build-Depends:
	       base (>= 4.9 && < 5.0)
	     , propellor >= 4.7.6
	-    , threepenny-gui (== 0.8.0.0)
	+    , threepenny-gui (== 0.7.0.1)
	     , random (>= 1.1)
	     , random-shuffle (>= 0.0.4)
	     , filepath (>= 1.4)

That because `stack.yaml` has a package line

	- http://github.com/joeyh/threepenny-gui/archive/59242cf93bdb8eaa805f5c2b0241e9a1cba9a70f.zip

where I think/assume the 0.7.0.1 comes from.
