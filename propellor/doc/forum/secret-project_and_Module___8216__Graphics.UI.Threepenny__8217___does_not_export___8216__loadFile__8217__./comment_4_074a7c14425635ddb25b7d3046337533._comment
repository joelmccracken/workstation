Without a version for threepenny-ui in secret-project.cabal gets 0.7.0.1 installed by `stack build`.

Where 0.7.0.1 comes from is unclear to me.
Downloading and unzipping <https://github.com/joeyh/threepenny-gui/archive/59242cf93bdb8eaa805f5c2b0241e9a1cba9a70f.zip> didn't reveal any 0.7.0.1.

Having `threepenny-gui (>= 0.8.0.0)` in secret-project.cabal gives this compile error:

	
	Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:
	
	In the dependencies for secret-project-0.0:
	    threepenny-gui-0.7.0.1 from stack configuration does not match (>=0.8.0.0) (latest matching version
	                           is 0.8.2.0)
	needed since secret-project is a build target.
	
	Some potential ways to resolve this:
	
	  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps
	    in /home/stappers/src/secret-project/stack.yaml:
	
	- threepenny-gui-0.8.2.0
	
	  * Set 'allow-newer: true' to ignore all version constraints and build anyway.
	
	  * You may also want to try using the 'stack solver' command.
	
	Plan construction failed.
