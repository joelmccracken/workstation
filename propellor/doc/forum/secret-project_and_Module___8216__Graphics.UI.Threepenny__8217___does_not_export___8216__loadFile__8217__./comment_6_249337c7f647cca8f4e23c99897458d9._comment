You need this for it to build with the newer stack:

	--- a/stack.yaml
	+++ b/stack.yaml
	@@ -4,4 +4,5 @@ packages:
	 resolver: lts-8.12
	 extra-deps:
	 - propellor-5.1.0
	+- archive: http://github.com/joeyh/threepenny-gui/archive/59242cf93bdb8eaa805f5c2b0241e9a1cba9a70f.zip
	 explicit-setup-deps:

However, that won't work with the 
[stack currently in debian](http://package.debian.org/haskell-stack)
and since secret-project later installs that version of stack and runs
it against the same stack.yaml file, I can't commit that change until 
Debian gets around to [upgrading haskell-stack](http://bugs.debian.org/877256)
