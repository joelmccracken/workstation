The zip file pointed to by the stack.yaml file contains a patched version
of threepenny-gui 0.8.0.0, the same as the cabal file requires.

Downgrading the dependency won't work, thus your build problems. All I can
tell you is it's built successfully with stack every time I've tried to
build it, and stack pins all package versions to ensure a reproducible
build.

It may be that you're using too old a version of stack or 
something like that; I've used stack 1.1.2.
