There did not used to be a good way to do that, but since propellor 3.2.3,
when you run eg "propellor --spin host", it first checks to see if there is
a `./config.hs` file, and if so, uses it instead of the user-global
`~/.propellor/config.hs`.

So, just make different git repos for the different projects with propellor
`config.hs` files in them, and `cd` into the one you want to run before running
propellor.
