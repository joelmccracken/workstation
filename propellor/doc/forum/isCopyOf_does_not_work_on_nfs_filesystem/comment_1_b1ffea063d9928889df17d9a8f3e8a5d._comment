Your NFS server must have root squash enabled then. So any propellor
properties that try to set the owner will fail (File.ownerGroup).

It's entirely reasonable for properties to need to set the owner of a file.
Many properties make files owned by a specific user and having them
squashed to "nobody" would break their purpose.

There's only one property in propellor that currently uses File.isCopyOf,
and that property is in fact installing a user's configuration file, which
needs to be owned by that user. So changing that property's behavior is
out.

So your options are, disable the NFS root squash, or avoid using propellor
properties that set file ownership. If you wanted to make a variant of
isCopyOf that didn't preserve permissions, we could perhaps look at adding
that to propellor.
