Hi Joey,

thank you for the feedback. I'm glad to know it is supposed to work in those cases.
It seems freedombox uses btrfs and swapfiles do not work on btrfs partitions. I thus tried with zram (apt get install zram-tools, which set up a 256 MiB swap).

I could then run propellor --spin to the server, it passed.
Then I rm -rf /usr/local/propellor on server and ran propellor --spin again.
The build passed again (it took ~75 minute and at some point ghc took 570MiB but it succeedded).

I'm back on track, thank you again!
