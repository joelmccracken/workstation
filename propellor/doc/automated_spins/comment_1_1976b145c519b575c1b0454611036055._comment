I just noticed the existence of this conductor property, which seems really interesting. I was trying to understand if and how it would be possible to spinning hosts in parallel. This could be done either as part of a conductor's run, e.g. by traversing the graph in parallel, or from command-line. It seems to me I could use directly `spin` or `spin'` functions to do that from forked threads or processes, with the master process doing the spin commit, but I may be overlooking some potential issues...
