Yes, that was the main reason to add
[Propellor.Property.Concurrent](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor-2.16.0/docs/Propellor-Property-Concurrent.html)

It should be able to parallelize any properties using the combinators in
there. Including `Propellor.Property.Conductor.conducts`

For example:

	conducts hostfoo `concurrently` conducts hostbar `concurrently` conducts hostbaz

Or, something like this to conduct a whole list of hosts in parallel
(have not tried to compile it, may need minor tweaking):

	concurrentList (pure 10) "conduct web servers in parallel" $
		PropList $ map toProp $ conduct webservers

	webservers :: [Host]

Note that concurrent output will be serialized, so you'll probably see propellor
running live on the first host and then the ones that were conducted in the
background will have their output dumped the console later on.
