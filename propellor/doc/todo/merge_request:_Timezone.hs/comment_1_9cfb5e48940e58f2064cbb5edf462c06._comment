I generally consider properties that do work every time to be a minor bug.

I wonder if it would be better to preseed tzdata rather than writing the
config file. I observe the same substitution from eg, US/Eastern to
America/New_York in the file when reconfiguring noninteractively,
but reconfiguring interactively I can select US/Eastern and that gets
into the file.

Anyway, merged as this is certianly a good starting point.
