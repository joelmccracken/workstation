When configuring both IPv4 and IPv6 for an interface, the interfaces files
should contains something like this:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.1
    iface eth0 inet6 static
        address fdb2:c09e:ee01:1:1

I made a patch for Network to allow this, please pull the network-stanzas branch at
http://git.ni.fr.eu.org/nicolas/propellor.git.
