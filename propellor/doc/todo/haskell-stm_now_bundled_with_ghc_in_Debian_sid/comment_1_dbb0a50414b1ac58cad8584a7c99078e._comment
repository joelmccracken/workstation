Bootstrap's package installation ignores errors, so if the package is not
available, it will at worst display an error message and continue.

However, I went ahead and made it check with apt-cache if the package is
available, to avoid the user seeing an apt error here.

I suppose users of Arch and FreeBSD may want to make similar changes, if
their package managers also display errors; I don't know if they do or even
if this change is going to affect those distributions.
Probably better to let those users deal with it if similar changes are made
to those distributions, so I'm going to close this.
