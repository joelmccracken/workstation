Ah, very nice :)

I reverted my GHC 6 commits and the merge with your master branch is now clean.

Some changelog text you can use:

- New info property Schroot.useOverlays to indicate whether you want schroots set up by propellor to use the Linux kernel's OverlayFS.
- Schroot.overlaysInTmpfs sets Schroot.useOverlays info property.
- If you have indicated that you want schroots to use OverlayFS and the current kernel does not support it, Sbuild.built will attempt to reboot into a kernel that does, or fail if it can't find one.
- Sbuild.built will no longer add duplicate `aliases=UNRELEASED,sid...` lines to more than one schroot config.  It will not remove any such lines that the previous version of propellor added, though.
- Sbuild.keypairGenerated works around Debian bug #792100 by creating the directory /root/.gnupg in advance.
- Improved Sbuild module haddock.
- Ccache.hasCache now sets the setgid bit on the cache directory, as ccache requires.
