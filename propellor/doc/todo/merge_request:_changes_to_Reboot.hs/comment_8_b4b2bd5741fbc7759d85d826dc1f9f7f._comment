Please consider merging my new `reboot` branch which addresses the discussion we've had.

I also included some other improvements to `Sbuild.hs`, a bug fix in `Ccache.hs` and some GHC 7.6 compatibility fixes.  With one exception,[1] I think that the changes are sufficiently self-explanatory that `git diff master..spwhitton/reboot` will be enough for you to review the branch.  If not, I will happily split the commits into several branches.

[1] I changed the haddocks on some functions in Sbuild.hs so that they will be properly hyperlinked, and did some other documentation rearrangements.
