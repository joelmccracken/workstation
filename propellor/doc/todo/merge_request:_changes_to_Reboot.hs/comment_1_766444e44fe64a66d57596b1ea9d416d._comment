While I've merged this, I am unsure if Reboot.toKernelNewerThan
should stop propellor from ensuring any subsequent properties.

That works if we have:

	& toKernelNewerThan foo
	& Sbuild.built

But not if the two properties are flipped. So, doesn't it follow
that Sbuild.built is a buggy property?

If Sbuild.built needs a particular kernel version running,
it could requires toKernelNewerThan. Then any use of Sbuild.built
would make sure the right kernel is running, rebooting into it if
necessary. 

And, if toKernelNewerThan failed due to the right kernel version not being
installed, Sbuild.built would be prevented from running. In which case, it
would be fine for propellor to continue on with ensuring other unrelated
properties.
