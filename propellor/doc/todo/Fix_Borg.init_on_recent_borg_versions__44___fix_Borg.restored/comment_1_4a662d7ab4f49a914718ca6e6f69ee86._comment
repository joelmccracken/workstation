I wonder if perhaps you forgot to run `git update-server-info`?
Or possibly this is just not an url that actually points to the raw git
repo, it looks like a gitweb installation and gitweb does not serve git
repos IIRC.

Hardcoding `BORG_PASSPHRASE` into a propellor configuration does not seem
good. It could use `withPrivData` to get the passphrase.

If `latestArchive` didn't work, it should probably display a
`warningMessage` rather than just failing with no indication why.

There is the small problem that borg 1.0.9 is in debian oldstable and if
someone were using propellor with it, which is supported, the changes
to extraction would break that. Not as bad as extraction currently being
broken for everyone with a current version of borg though! But,
it would be easy to at least detect the old version and refuse to use it to
restore. Either by borg --version or by using withOS and to match against
the debian version, like Propellor.Property.Systemd.machined does.
