Currently, building an Image for a Host requires a partition table to be
specified separately. However, Propellor.Property.Machine often knows
things about the partition table (eg that there needs to be a separate EXT2
/boot partition). So, why not let properties put something in Info and
let the partition table be derived from that. --[[Joey]]
