Hello,

I had a problem where propellor refused to create a chroot because the target
directory was not empty. Actually, the directory contained `lost+found`.

I made a patch to ignore this directory, do you see any bad side effect?

You can pull the `ignore-lost-n-found` branch at `http://git.ni.fr.eu.org/nicolas/propellor.git`.

Nicolas.
