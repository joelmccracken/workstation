Since "git pull" has the potential to fail because of merge problems (this is not theoretical, it happened to me today), I'd prefer to just fetch into a bare repo.
I don't know the best way to go about this. Maybe a "Git.fetched" function that does not assume a non-bare repo (as Git.cloned currently does).
