After upgrading to 2.4.0, I get this error:

    Configuring propellor-2.4.0...
    cabal: At least the following dependencies are missing:
    exceptions -any
    propellor: failed to make dist/setup-config
    Shared connection to myserver closed.
    propellor: remote propellor failed

As in https://propellor.branchable.com/todo/issue_after_upgrading_shared_library/, manually running "make clean" on the server fixed the issue

> Ok, this is the same as [[problem_with_spin_after_new_dependencies_added]]. Closing this issue as I'm dealing with it in the other one. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
