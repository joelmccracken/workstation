Would be useful to have a `hostChroot :: Host -> Chroot`.

For a Debian host, this would use debootstrapped and pass all the Host's
properties to it. --[[Joey]] 

Would need to make privdata use the context of the input Host. And would
need to propigate privdata info, but not other info. --[[Joey]]
