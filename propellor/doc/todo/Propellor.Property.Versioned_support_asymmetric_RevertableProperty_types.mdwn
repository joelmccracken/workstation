Currently, this module requires `RevertableProperty t t`.
That can be annoying, it would be good to support at least
`RevertablePropery (HasInfo + t) t` and ideally all 
`RevertableProperty t1 t2`

There should be no reason that can't be done; I was just having
problems getting the type checker happy on the day I wrote it. --[[Joey]]
