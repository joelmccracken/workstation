Thank you for the detailed report.

I think the problem is the proxy propagation happens after the sbuild-createchroot command has run, but if the sbuild-createchroot command needs the proxy, it will fail in the way you describe.

After speaking to Joey at DebConf I think I can rework the sbuild module to bypass sbuild-createchroot and run debootstrap itself, without thereby polluting the chroot that is created.  That should make it much easier to fix this bug, so I'll do that first.
