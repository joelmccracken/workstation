Not sure why unpropelling blocks this. IIRC we discussed using a regular
propellor chroot to set up the sbuild chroot. And I pointed out that when
propellor runs inside a chroot, it does it without installing any
dependencies into the chroot; everything propellor needs to run is
bind mounted into /usr/local/propellor in the chroot.

So, the most an "unpropell" property would need to do in a chroot is to
unmount below /usr/local/propellor and remove that directory, which should
then be empty. This might be desirable to be sure that the sbuild
environment is 100% clean, in the unlikely chance that something
builds differently when /usr/local/propellor exists.
