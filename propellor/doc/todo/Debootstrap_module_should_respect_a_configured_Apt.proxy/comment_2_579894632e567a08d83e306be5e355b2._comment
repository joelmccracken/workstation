Hello, so I try to restart from scratch and ask for a stretch Sbuild

everything went fine until the update


    I: schroot chroot configuration written to /etc/schroot/chroot.d/stretch-amd64-propellor-VYWULd.

        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").
    I: Setting reference package list.
    I: Updating chroot.


On my network, I need a proxy so I setup the host with 

    ...
    & Apt.proxy myproxy
    & Sbuild.builtFor stretch Sbuild.UseCcache

If I understand correctly the Apt.proxy should propagate the Apt.proxy into the Sbuild
but when I look inside the chroot, I can not find the 

    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20proxy

file which is on the host

And Indeed after a certain amount of time, the network gives a timeout

    Err:1 http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch InRelease
      Cannot initiate the connection to deb.debian.org:80 (2001:41c8:1000:21::21:4). - connect (101: Network is unreachable) [IP: 2001:41c8:1000:21::21:4 80]

    I: Successfully set up stretch chroot.
    I: Run \"sbuild-adduser\" to add new sbuild users.
    sixs7.exp.synchrotron-soleil.fr sbuild schroot for System (Debian Linux (Stable \"stretch\")) X86_64 ... done

the good news is that now the schroot file contain the right informations

    [stretch-amd64-sbuild]
    description=Debian stretch/amd64 autobuilder
    groups=root,sbuild
    root-groups=root,sbuild
    profile=sbuild
    type=directory
    directory=/srv/chroot/stretch-amd64
    union-type=overlay
    command-prefix=/var/cache/ccache-sbuild/sbuild-setup,eatmydata


So to summarize, I think that the Apt.proxy propagation does not work.

This propagation should be optional because sometime we prepare images which are not meant to be used behind a proxy (where they were prepare)

thanks for your attention :)
