Hello,

I use propellor to deploy systemd containers. I have a problem with
`Hostname.setTo`, it sets the hostname in `/etc/hostname`, but the container
hostname is not set until I restart the container.

Note: I use `Systemd.containerCfg "network-bridge=br0"`, so the container has
a different network stack.

I suppose that the `check (not <$> inChroot)` might be the problem here.
