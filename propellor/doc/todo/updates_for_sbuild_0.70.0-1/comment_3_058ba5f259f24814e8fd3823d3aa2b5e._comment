Please consider merging my `sbuild-0.71.0` branch.

The only functional change is that `Sbuild.keygen{Insecurely,}Generated` are now optional.

The rest of the changes are documentation.  They explain precisely when you need `Sbuild.keygenGenerated`, how to deal with the gpg->gpg2 issues that have arisen recently (not this module's fault) and make clearer some situations the module was never able to deal with (e.g. building for squeeze).
