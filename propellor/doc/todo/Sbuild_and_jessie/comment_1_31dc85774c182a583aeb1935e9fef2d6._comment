I think that the issue is that under jessie the binary is named `adt-run` not `autopkgtest`.  In which case, the problem is in `Sbuild.userConfig` which refers to `autopkgtest`.  Maybe `Sbuild.useConfig`'s haddock should say that it is for stretch and newer.

`Sbuild.built` already installs `autopkgtest` (by means of `Sbuild.preReqsInstalled`).  So I don't see how installing that package could have fixed the problem.  Possibly you installed from jessie-backports, and maybe that version provides `/usr/bin/autopkgtest`?
