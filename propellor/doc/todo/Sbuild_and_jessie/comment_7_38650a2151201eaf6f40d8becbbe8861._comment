I started preparing a patch so that `Sbuild.userConfig` would install the backport on Jessie, but realised that what is probably going on is that you have a backport of sbuild installed -- I assume that the sbuild that comes with jessie tries to invoke `adt-run` not `autopkgtest`.  So `Sbuild.userConfig` would have to check the installed version of sbuild before it could determine whether to install the backport of autopkgtest.

I think it would be unwise to incorporate that complexity into Sbuild.hs for the sake of an old release of Debian, so I've mailed a patch to Joey simply documenting the issue.
