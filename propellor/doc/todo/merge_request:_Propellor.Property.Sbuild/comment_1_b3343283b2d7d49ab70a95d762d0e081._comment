Re not running propellor in the sbuild chroot, I have in the past used
schroot for things where it would have made sense to run propellor
in the chroot. OTOH, systemd-container is a better fit for such uses cases
now, probably.

Is the ~/.sbuildrc necessary to use the sbuild properties? If so, 
would it make sense to have a property that configures it?

You could use Utility.DataUnits for Ccache's MaxSize. This would be
more flexible and consistent with other things in propellor.

Limit could be a monoid. This would perhaps simplify hasGroupCache
as it could only be used once to set multiple limits.

Maybe instead of Ccache.hasGroupCache, call it Ccache.hasCache?

That is a weird build warning! But, I don't see it with ghc 7.10.3.
Normally you'd see that warning when the module's export list exported the same
symbol twice.
