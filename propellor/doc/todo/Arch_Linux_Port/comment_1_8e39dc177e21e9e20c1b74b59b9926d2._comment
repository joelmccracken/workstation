Wow, nice work!

Seems that Propellor.Property.Partition.formatted' is still a DebianLike
property really, since it only supports using apt to install the mkfs
programs. It will fail at runtime on Arch. So, I think best to keep it
DebianLike until that's dealt with -- and then the type will be 
`DebianLike + ArchLinux` rather than `LinuxLike`

Same for Propellor.Property.Partition.kpartx.

Several properties that were changed from DebianLike to Linux really
only support DebianLike and ArchLinux, not all linux distros, so their
types ought to be `DebianLike + ArchLinux`. This includes Docker.installed,
Parted.installed, Rsync.installed.

A nicer way to inplement those multi-distro `installed` properties is like
this:

	installed :: Property (Debian + ArchLinux)
	installed = Apt.installed ["foo"] `pickOS` Pacman.installed ["foo"]

Make those changes and I will merge it.
