Looking at it, kpartx is DebianLike-specific, so imageBuiltFrom which uses it
should be too. The only reason it wasn't marked as DebianLike already and
was type Linux is because Linux used to be the same as DebianLike and so
the type checker didn't see a difference. No longer, thanks to your patch.

So, it makes complete sense that you have to change this. You're paying
the price of blazing the trail of the first non-DebianLike Linux distro in
Propellor..

Looks like your [[!commit 25f6871e1dda3de252fbc6c8ac6962eb0cd9311a]]
dealt with all my review suggestions. And so, I've merged it.

Unless you have anything else that needs to be done, I'll release
propellor soon with the added Arch Linux support. Thank you very much!
