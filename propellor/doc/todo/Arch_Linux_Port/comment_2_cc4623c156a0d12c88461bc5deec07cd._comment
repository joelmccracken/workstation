Thanks!


I didn't find the right way to do it;  `pickOS` is so much easier than `withOS` !


`Propellor.Property.Partition` was modified to get rid of some compiling errors in DiskImage and didn't support anything new. So I removed the changes.


Instead,  I changed some properties in DiskImage from Linux to DebianLike.  Is it the correct way to do it?
