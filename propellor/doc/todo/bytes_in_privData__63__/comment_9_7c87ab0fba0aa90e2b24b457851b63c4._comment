Thank you, Andrew!

Before I merge this, I want to clear up something that confuses me;
you characterized this as a bug that has bit you. How did the
pre-bytestring File.hasContentProtected exhibit buggy behavior?

AFAICS, it already supported binary privdata, just in a suboptimal
way.

(Also fileProperty and bytesProperty should indeed be deduped;
a second patch that merges them, even with an API change, would be ok.)
