I tried to do the conversion, but then it started a kind of chain reaction... (PrivData=ByteString to writeFileProtected to Line=ByteString to ... to readProcess to ...) Should I use FilePath=String? ... To be honest, the patch became a lot bigger that what I am comfortable with. :-)

I guess you should have a look at it...

At least, I think there is a type bug in Propellor.Property.File:

    hasPrivContent' :: (IsContext c, IsPrivDataSource s) => (String -> FilePath -> IO ()) -> s -> FilePath -> c -> Property HasInfo

but it should be

    hasPrivContent' :: (IsContext c, IsPrivDataSource s) => (FilePath -> String -> IO ()) -> s -> FilePath -> c -> Property HasInfo

(it is hidden by FilePath = String)
