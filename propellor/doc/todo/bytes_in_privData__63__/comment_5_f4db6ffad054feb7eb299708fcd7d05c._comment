Can you put the patch up somewhere? I'll take a look. Might see a way to
short-curcuit the bytestring before everything becomes one..

One way might be:

	writeFileProtected :: FileContent content => FilePath -> content -> IO ()

Which would also at least partly avoid foot-shooting over which parameter is which.
(Fixed that type signature.)
