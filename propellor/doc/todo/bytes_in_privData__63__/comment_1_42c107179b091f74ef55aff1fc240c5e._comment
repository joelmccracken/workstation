I imagine that adding `fileEncoding stdin` to setPrivData will fix
this crash, but I'd expect there are also other problems with encodings
for privdata that haskell doesn't like. Similar fixes would probably
be needed in several other places. 

Probably cleaner and better to convert
`PrivData` from a String to a ByteString, and so avoid encodings
being applied to it. I think this could be done without changing the
file format; the privdata file uses Read/Show for serialization,
and happily ByteString uses the same Read/Show format as String does.

So, changing the type and following the compile errors should get you
there, I think!
