Hmm, the way Strings are used for PrivData takes advantage of ghc's
"filename encoding", which is supposed to allow arbitrary bytes to be
included in filenames; unicode surrogate characters are used to map
them to unicode.

But, Property.File is using readFile, witeFile, and writeFileProtected,
which will bail on invalid unicode as the filename encoding is not used.
Your patch avoids that problem I see.
