You need to update the Debian package to include the propellor
haskell library in binary form. I had not included the haskell library in
the package before in binary form, because I was targeting only option A,
where it's cloned from the git archive in the package.

Any other installation method than the debian package that I know of
installs both the propellor command and the propellor haskell library.

(Note that propellor 3.0.1^W3.0.3 fixes an unrelated bug that prevented option B
from working.)
