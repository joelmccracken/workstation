Please consider merging branch `hothasktags` of my repo `https://git.spwhitton.name/propellor`

Moves the `2>/dev/null` redirection in the Makefile rule for `tags` in order to silence xargs if hothasktags is not installed (avoids `xargs: hothasktags: No such file or directory`).

I assume that your originally intention was not to cause an error if hothasktags is not installed, since you have `|| true` at the end of the line.  However, someone trying to build propellor's Debian package saw the error output from xargs and thought it meant hothasktags should be a build-dep.  This patch prevents someone thinking that.
