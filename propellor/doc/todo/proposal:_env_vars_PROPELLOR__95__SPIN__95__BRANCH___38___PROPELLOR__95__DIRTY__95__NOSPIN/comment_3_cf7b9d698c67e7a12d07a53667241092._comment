I've implemented these in the `safetychecks` branch of `https://git.spwhitton.name/propellor`.

A nice side effect of my implementation is that the spin only errors out after there's been an attempt to compile Propellor.  So you can run `propellor --spin` in order to have GHC typecheck your code on a feature branch.
