I'd use `PROPELLOR_SPIN_BRANCH`. No objections to `PROPELLOR_DIRTY_NOSPIN`
as long as it's not default.

Note that Cron.runPropellor does not use /usr/bin/propellor, and there are
other ways of running propellor that don't use that wrapper. So I don't
think the wrapper is the place to implement this kind of thing.

Why use environment variables for configuration? That makes it hard to make
sure propellor gets the same configuration every way it can be run. And,
propellor has a config file. :)

Implementation could be something like, add a `configuredMain` that takes a
monoidial configuration value for such global config settings. 
(so `defaultMain = configuredMain mempty`)

Hmm, I suppose the issue with `PROPELLOR_SPIN_BRANCH` is that when a
different branch is checked out, that branch's config.hs would not have that
configured, or would perhaps set it to use that branch. So, that's why
you were thinking environment variables?

Maybe use git-config?
