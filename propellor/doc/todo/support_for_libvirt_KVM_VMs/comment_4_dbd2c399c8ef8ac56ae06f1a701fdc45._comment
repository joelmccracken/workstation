I do think that the conditional property would be a good way for this to
work.

I think there could also be VMs where you don't want the overhead of
running propellor inside the VM (especially if the emulation is slow, or
you don't want to allocate that much memory to the VM, or just have a lot
of VMs), and the content is disposable. Then propellor could restart the VM
when it changes the disk image.

There's room for multiple ways to do it.. 

The disk image building side of this looks easy to me, so if you do the libvirt
stuff, Sean, I might contribute something. :)
