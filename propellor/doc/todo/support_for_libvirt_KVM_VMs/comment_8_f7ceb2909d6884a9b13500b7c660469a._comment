Seems that kvmRunning would need a warning that changes to the propellor
configuration of the VM's Host won't affect the VM. Because it's unusual for
propellor to only be able to set something up and not change it afterwards.

But kvmRunning is certianly a useful low level property, and combining with
other properties like that is good.

Hmm, it's actually possible to mount a qcow2 image using libguestfs-tools.
<http://ask.xmodulo.com/mount-qcow2-disk-image-linux.html>
So, propellor could temporarily take down the VM and run inside the qcow2
to update it! Although doing that every time propellor is run seems
suboptimal. It could keep the chroot around and only update the qcow2 image
if the chroot needed to be updated. I am not sure how I feel about that
idea.

We could also make conducting easier to set up, perhaps not needing `main`
to be modified to use it.
