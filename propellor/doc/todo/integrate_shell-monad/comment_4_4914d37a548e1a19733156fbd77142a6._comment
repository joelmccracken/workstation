We already have /usr/local/bin/propellor executable, so the cron job or
whatever could be made to run it with a parameter that runs the turtle IO
action. (Or generally, any IO action.. Being able to run arbitrary haskell
IO code as a cron job would be great!)

This would need some way to get a `UniqueId` for an IO action, that is
stable across runs of propellor, and a way to build up a` Map UniqueId (IO ())` of such
actions. The Info interface could be used to build up that Map.

----

Some of the places I'd like to use shell-monad though are where propellor
is bootstrapping itself on a host and all it can easily run at that point
is shell script.
