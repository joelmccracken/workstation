Could use a tuple of a Data.Unique for the current build of propellor,
and a propellor build ID (eg, git rev that was built).

That would make sure that propellor runs the correct IO action.
But, when propellor is updated, any cron jobs etc that try to run
with the old UniqueId would fail. Unless the old propellor binary
could be cached away and used as a fallback, I suppose..
