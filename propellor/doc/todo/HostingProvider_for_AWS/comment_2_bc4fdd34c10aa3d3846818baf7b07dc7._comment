It just so happens I have a use case for this, and it'll also involve specifics for VPCs, Encryption at Rest, public vs private subnets, and a whole lot of other compliance stuff that would be great to be able to express as properties. I'll start in on something probably shortly. It's either that or try and make Chef compliant, and that's literally completely unappealing.
