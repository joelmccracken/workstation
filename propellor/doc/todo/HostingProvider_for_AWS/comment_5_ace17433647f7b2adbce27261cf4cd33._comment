[Amazonka](http://brendanhay.nz/amazonka-doc/amazonka-ec2/index.html) is really thorough, and I think I'm going to start writing some properties to spin up some things tomorrow. I wrote some PKI stuff today for work so we can start launching things without SSH open to the world, and this is definitely a good next step.

I've already got a hand-mashed set of subnets I'm really itching to automate. 



Thanks
