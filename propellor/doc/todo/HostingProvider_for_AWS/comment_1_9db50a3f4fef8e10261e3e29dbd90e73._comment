So there's something here that propellor doesn't yet have a concept of,
and that's spinning up a VM. Propellor can deploy itself to an existing VM
pretty well, but getting the VM running isn't something it tries to do.

I imagine that --spin could be extended to support this though.
Make a Property like `vm AWS`, which tells propellor that the host
is a VM, and that the VM is hosted on AWS. Then when you run propellor
--spin, it could set up the VM if it doesn't exist yet.

I don't use AWS currently, so don't have plans to work on this myself,
although I think it would be a great direction to move in. Happy to help
with advice, code review, etc.

<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws>
or <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka>
are good haskell libraries for working with AWS.
