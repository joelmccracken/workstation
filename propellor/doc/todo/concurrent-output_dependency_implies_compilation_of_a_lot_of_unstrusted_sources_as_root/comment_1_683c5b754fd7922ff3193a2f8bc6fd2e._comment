Yes, cabal is not secure from MITM.

I've rethought adding that dependency so soon. I'll change back to bundling
concurrent-output in 3.0.1. 

I can force ghc to build the concurrent-output
module with -O2 as needed to get good memory use, and still let the rest of
propellor build with -O0, which was the main motivation for unbundling it.
