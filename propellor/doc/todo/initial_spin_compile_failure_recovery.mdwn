When initial propellor --spin host fails to compile propellor
perhaps due to a ghc compatability bug, spinning again doesn't fix the
problem. IIRC /usr/local/propellor has a git repo set up, but no remote
set, and so the subsequent spin doesn't update it, since propellor is not
running there to receive a git push into the repo. --[[Joey]]
