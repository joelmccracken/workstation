The recent dependency on concurrent-output adding implies downloading, compiling, and executing as root of many (MissingH, hslogger, process, unix-compat, network, directory, ansi-terminal, unix, ...)  unstrusted sources. This seems like a huge security problem...

Are these at least downloaded using https?
