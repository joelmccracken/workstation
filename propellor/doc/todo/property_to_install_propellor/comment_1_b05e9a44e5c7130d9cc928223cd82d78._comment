Making this work when propellor is setting up a chroot is difficult,
because the localdir is bind mounted into the chroot.

Hmm, `unshare` could be helpful. Run shell commands to clone the localdir
inside `unshare -m`, prefixed with a `umount localdir`. This way, the bind
mount is avoided, and it writes "under" it. Limits the commands that can be
run to set up the localdir to shell commands, but bootstrap already
operates on terms of shell commands so that seems ok.

`unshare` is linux-specific; comes in util-linux on modern linuxes.
