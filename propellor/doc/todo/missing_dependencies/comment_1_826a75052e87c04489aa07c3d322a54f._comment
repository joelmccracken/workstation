`exceptions` is indeed a new dependency.

This is supposed to be handled by Propellor.Bootstrap.checkDepsCommand
which is run by --spin.

Maybe check if your propellor.cabal includes the `exceptions` dependency,
and check if `cabal configure` fails. If it does, it seems like that code
would fire, and should install the missing dependency. It worked when I
upgraded my systems with it, is all I know.
