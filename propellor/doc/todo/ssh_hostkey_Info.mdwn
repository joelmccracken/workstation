* Either `Ssh.hostKey` should set the sshPubKey info
  (which seems hard, as info needs to be able to be calculated without
  running any IO code, and here IO is needed along with decrypting the
  PrivData..), or the public key should not be stored in
  the PrivData, and instead configured using the info.
  Getting the ssh host key into the info will allow automatically
  exporting it via DNS (SSHFP record)

[[done]]; although I did not implement SSHFTP yet, it should be doable now.
