Seems I blanked on your `changesFile` combinator when I sat down to write mine.  Taking a look now, my approach is much more direct for cases like `Apt.buildDep` when the problem is registering a change when there should be NoChange, whereas I think the intention of your changesFile is the opposite case.  Though it might be nice to combine them.  Let me know what you think.
