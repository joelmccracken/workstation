I had a thought about this;
[[trivial is a code smell|type-level_trivial_avoidance]] and adding
UncheckedProperty type avoids needing to use trivial.

So, now cmdProperty, runApt, and other things that make a Property but
can't really detect when it MadeChange can instead make an
UncheckedProperty, and changesFile is one of the ways to convert that into
a Property.

My implementation also allows applying changesFile multiple times, to
detect a change to multiple files.
