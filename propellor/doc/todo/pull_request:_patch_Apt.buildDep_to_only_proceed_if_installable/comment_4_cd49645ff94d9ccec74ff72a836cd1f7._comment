I think it would probably depend on the user when that makes sense to do.
If I'm installing build deps over a slow network connection, I'd like to
see the output.

It would be awesome if this transformation could be applied to any 
arbitrary Property. I don't immediately know how to do that, although it
seems useful that all process spawning already goes through
concurrent-output, which can buffer the output and display it only when the
command finishes.

Perhaps an extension to concurrent-ouput could let it buffer the output
of all commands run by a property and then discard the buffer if the
property finished with NoChange. But I don't see a way to make this work
when multiple properties are being run concurrently.
