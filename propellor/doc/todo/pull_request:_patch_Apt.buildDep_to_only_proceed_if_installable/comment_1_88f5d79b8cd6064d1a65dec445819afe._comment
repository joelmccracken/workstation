Looks like Build-Depends-Index is not handled, nor are 'a | b' build deps,
or arch-specific build deps. Since versions are skipped, if a build dep
needed a newer version, the property also wouldn't try to upgrade to it
after this change.

I feel that parsing build deps is too complex for propellor.

It might work to somehow detect if apt has made any changes.
