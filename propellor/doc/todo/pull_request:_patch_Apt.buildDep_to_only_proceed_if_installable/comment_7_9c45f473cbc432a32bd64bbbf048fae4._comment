The two combinators are indeed very similar. The reason I wrote
changesFile the way I did is that that allows it to be applied repeatedly
when a property can change any of several files.

	trivial someprop
		`changesFile` "foo"
		`changesFile` "bar"

That seems fairly likely to come up, while it would be unusual for a
property to have to change multiple files at once to be considered
to make a change at all, which is what multiple applications of
`noChangeIfUnchanged` leads to.

But neither combinator causes apt's output to not be displayed,
which is what I thought we were talking about.
