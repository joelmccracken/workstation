I can't see any docker-engine package in any version of Debian. Unstable
still has a docker.io, though testing does not (update: it does now; the
docker package also recently got updated to a more current version).
Docker was not included in the last stable release.

I have not used docker in quite some time. I use systemd-nspawn containers
which are much easier to build and maintain. So, it may make sense to
either mark the docker module in propellor as unmaintained, or find someone
else to maintain it.
