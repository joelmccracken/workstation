Running "sudo ./propellor" is documented as a way to provision the local
host. However, properties involving chroots and docker hard code localdir,
so run /usr/local/propellor/propellor inside the chroot. When running
propellor this way, that may not exist, or may be from some other propellor
configuration and not know how to privision the chroot correctly.

Should this stuff look at the path to the propellor executable that's
really being run and use it? There's also the shimdir, which is under
/usr/local/propellor and gets bind mounted into the chroot, so using
something close to the executable run by "sudo ./propellor" may be
surprising. And, exposeTrueLocaldir also uses the localdir.

It may make more sense to detect when propellor is run this way and refuse
to provision chroots. Or to eliminate this little-used way of running
propellor entirely.. --[[Joey]]
