`stack install propellor` is already supported, and when `propellor --init`
detects it was installed that way, it will set up the user's propellor 
config to also be built using stack locally (via `git config
propellor.buildsystem stack`).

Supporting using stack to build propellor on the Host too is
the missing part, and something I'd take a patch for.

Your patch as it stands discards the cabal support. 
But, I personally want to continue building propellor with cabal on my
Hosts, at least until stack is available in Debian stable, and
probably longer. (I use Debian's ghc and haskell packages for other things
on my hosts, so using stack would waste disk space.)

I feel there needs to be a way to configure this. It would probably be fine to
use stack on the remote host if the local propellor repository has
`git config propellor.buildsystem stack` set. Or perhaps it should be
configured in the config.hs.
