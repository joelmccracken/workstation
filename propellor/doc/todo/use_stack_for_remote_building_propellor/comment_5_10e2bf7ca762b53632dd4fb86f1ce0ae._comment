Following spwhitton's idea, this would involve adding a new property which 
configures the host it's attached to to build propellor using stack.

This can be accomplished by having the property set some Info which can
be looked at when propellor is deploying itself to the host, 
as shown in the precompiled branch.

I guess most people who want to build
propellor with stack would want to do that on all hosts. You could have a
`[Host] -> [Host]` function that added the stack property to a list of
hosts I suppose.
