OK. Indeed my patch is a bit brutal, that's one reason I have not proposed it straight away :-) 

I understand the rationale behind being flexible in how to build locally and remotely. Using a git config property seems pretty straightforward but I don't see how to do it within `config.hs`. Any suggestion?
