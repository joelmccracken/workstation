Thanks for looking at this, though looking as master you haven't actually merged my branch.

I'm reluctant to build in a lot of shell scripting logic to do better than `sleep 10`.  Do you think it would be worth writing a property that ensures that a process with a given pid file has been killed?  Or just an action in the propellor monad?
