> Yes please add a new type alias for String (or an ADT) if Package is not appropriate.

Propellor won't be parsing any of the regexp or globs, so I've added a new type alias rather than an ADT.

> Nice surprise that tightenTargets works on RevertableProperty at all. Since it does, you should be able to tighten one side, revert, tighten the other side, and re-revert. Or, deconstruct the RevertableProperty, tighten both sides individually, and reconstruct it.

I don't understand what you're getting at with the first of these suggestions.

In any case, now that I'm not using `File.containsBlock`, it's easy to just apply `tightenTargets` to each side.

> I've added a Propellor.Property.File.configFileName that should be suitable for your purposes, and others..

Very nice :)  I've updated my branch to use this.  I haven't removed `File.containsBlock`, since it might be useful in the future, but you could of course revert the relevant commit.
