Here's a almost-script to do it, which worked when it did it by hand:

<pre>
get old-head (git show-ref HEAD -s)
get curr-branch (refs/heads/master eg)
find old-commit (look back through git log for the first commit that was not "propellor spin")
git reset old-commit
git commit -a # user gets to edit commit message for all the spins and any staged changes here
git merge -S -s ours old-head
get current-commit (result of merge)
git update-ref curr-branch current-commit
git checkout curr-branch
</pre>
