sm noticed that running the propellor wrapper after stack install propellor
sets up ~/.propellor/ but fails to build in there, because it uses cabal.

So, it appeared to him as if the propellor command didn't accept switches,
since it never got to the point of running propellor-config. Which is
pretty confusing behavior.

To fully support stack, the wrapper or build process would need to notice
that it was installed using stack, and build using stack. This conflicts
somewhat with my idea about noticing if stack.yaml exists as the flag.
