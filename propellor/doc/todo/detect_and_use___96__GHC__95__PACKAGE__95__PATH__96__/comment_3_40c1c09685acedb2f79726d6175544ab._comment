Well, that's simple enough. Although there are a few other places that
buildFirst and updateFirst are used, so the patch is not quite complete.

I do want propellor to be able to be used with just cabal. For one thing,
Debian stable doesn't even include stack yet! For another, all propellor's
haskell dependencies are available in debian so it's overhead for stack to
build them all.

But, it'd be nice to support using stack too. If this were configurable
in some way that propellor could see, then Propellor.Bootstrap.build
could build with stack and update the symlink, and everything else would
work as-is.

So, what would be a good way to configure use of stack? It probably would
make sense to have it be a property of the Host, which also allows the
other bootstrap code to use stack to install dependencies. 

And then too, it could look at `GHC_PACKAGE_PATH`, so if your ~/.propellor
is built using stack once, it will keep on building itself using stack.
