Agree on all points. I would rather not add the dependencies to propellor
proper either, but such was the requirement for this change. I'd be happy
enough with the MonadBase IO derivation and implementing this externally,
no argument here.

As for what it does :) I cribbed the implementation from the Snap server (
https://github.com/snapframework/snap/blob/
bda15d0a0f29b0107fd69fbb8b7e8cc5ce5fa7e4/src/Snap/Snaplet/Internal/Types.hs#
L277),
and it seems to work, essentially it is a way to take the outer
transformer, and wrap it inside the inner Monad, but in such a way that the
inner Monad now has access to the outer transformer !? Yeah, I'm still not
fully grokking it myself, but it type checks and functions.

Anyway feel free to implement at your leisure, it does seem that I could
even derive the MonadBase IO instance manually and not have to change
Propellor in the least, though the auto-derived instance would seem like a
simple and harmless addition.
