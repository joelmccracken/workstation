I'm not entirely opposed to it, but this does add another two
dependencies that have to be installed on every host managed by propellor.

Also, I don't really understand the instance MonadBaseControl
implementation. (And have always had that difficulty with
monad-control, which is one of the reasons I've stopped using it.)
This and not having anything to test it with makes me fear maintaining it.

It looks like it would be sufficient make Propellor derive MonadBase IO,
and then the MonadBaseControl instance could be shipped in another
package (or even implemented in your config.hs). Does that sound like a
reasonable compromise?
