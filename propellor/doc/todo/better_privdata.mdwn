It can be annoying to need to move privdata values around when moving
services between hosts, which is otherwise often just a cut-n-paste
of a line in config.hs.

It would be better if privdata were all stored in one Map, and the set of
privdata that a host's current properties need were sent to it
automatically, rather than the current 1-file-per-host separation.

For this to work though, each property that uses privdata would need to add
to the host's Info the privdata field it uses.
