Hi, I'm trying to spin using the `Precompiled.precompiled` property from the `precompiled`, branch after having merged master. The first time trying to spin after adding the property, this error occurs:

    > ./propellor --spin host_redacted
    Build profile: -w ghc-8.8.4 -O1
    In order, the following will be built (use -v for more details):
     - propellor-5.11 (exe:propellor-config) (file executables/propellor-config.hs changed)
    Preprocessing executable 'propellor-config' for propellor-5.11..
    Building executable 'propellor-config' for propellor-5.11..

    tmp/Main.o )

    <git push output snipped>
    ldd: bin/propellor: No such file or directory
    propellor: user error (ldd [\"bin/propellor\"] exited 1)


Subsequent spin attempts produce this error:

    > ./propellor --spin us4.tempus.xyz
    Up to date
    Propellor build ... done
    <git push output snipped>
    cp: cannot stat '/home/jayess/propellor/propellor (deleted)': No such file or directory
    ** error: failed copying in propellor
    propellor: Cannot continue!
    CallStack (from HasCallStack):
      error, called at src/Propellor/Message.hs:143:9 in propellor-5.11-inplace:Propellor.Message

I think `Propellor.Spin.sendPrecompiled` might itself be broken, but I can't quite wrap my head around what's going on here. Any ideas? I'm using `cabal 3.0.0.0` in Debian Unstable.
