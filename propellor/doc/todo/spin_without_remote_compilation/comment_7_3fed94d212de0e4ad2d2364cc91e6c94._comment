Felix did some more work on this last April, in his precompiled-rebased-2
branch.

In particular, that branch is supposed to handle case #3 above (by a git
clone to temp dir and move of the files).

Felix said he had not tested it, and I have not tested it either. If
someone can try his branch and confirm that it works, including handling
of cases #2 and #3 above, I'd be happy to merge it.

(origin/precompiled has the above branch and has had current master
cleanly merged into it, and builds successfully.)
