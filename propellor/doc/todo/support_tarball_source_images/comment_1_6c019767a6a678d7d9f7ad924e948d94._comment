I've introduced a ChrootBootstrapper type class, of which Debootstrapped
is just one member. Everything that bootstraps chroots uses this
type class, so you can write a separate module that uses buildroot, or
whatever. And you're welcome to contribute such a module to propellor.

As far as having propellor generate a tarball of a chroot, the way to do
that is something like:

	chroot dir `onChange` mktarball dir

Ie, compose the chroot creation property with one that tars it up.
