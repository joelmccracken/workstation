I don't think it makes sense to add MinimalTarball as an operating System.

If you make ChrootTarball contain the FilePath to the tarball,
then ChrootBootstrapper ChrootTarball instance doesn't need to look
at the system parameter at all; instead it can just look inside the
ChrootTarball to get the path to it, and extract that.

So, the user would write, say:

	bootstrapped (System (Debian Unstable) "amd64") (ChrootTarball "/tmp/debian.tar.gz") "/chroot"

What might make sense it to change the first parameter of boostrapped 
to Maybe System, for cases where you don't want to specify it.

----

It would probably also be good to document what kind of tarball is
expected. Ie, that it can be compressed, and should not consist
of a single subdirectory, but one subdirectory for each top-level
root directory.

----

Also, as a minor point, I don't think you need to pass standardPathEnv;
it should be fine to use boolSystem with the regular enviroment as
far as I can see. In fact, you could probably simplify extractTarball
by implementing it like this:

	check (unpopulated target) $
		cmdProperty "tar" params
			`requires` File.dirExists target
