All this property needs to do when `inChroot` is True is unmount anything
bound below /usr/local/propellor and delete that directory, which should be
empty.

OF course it's harder to implement it for use outside a chroot, but a
property that works in a chroot would be enough for sbuild and would be a
reasonable start.

I don't think there's any sane way to remove cabal and stack cruft
without deleting it all.

Seems like to uninstall the build deps, it would be useful to get the build
deps installed in the first place in a way that makes `apt-get autoremove`
able to remove them. Currently, Bootstrap.depsCommand hardcodes
a list of debian packages. It could instead just install propellor.deb,
which depends on the same stuff, so the build deps get autoremoved after
propellor is removed. 

But, different versions of the propellor package might have different deps
than the version of propellor being bootstrapped.
