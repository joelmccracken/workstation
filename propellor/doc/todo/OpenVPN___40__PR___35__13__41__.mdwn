Oh! I hadn't realized 7.6.3 was the target, so I upgraded to 7.10.3 (which is what I've been using for things). I can definitely try a spin without it. I can't remember why I thought 7.6.3 was failing there but I'll definitely dig into it.

Oh yes, definitely. I'll take a pass at that too, and dig into Firewall to see what's there.

    CombinedType (Property NoInfo) (Property HasInfo)

That's an excellent question. I think ultimately I tried a type hole to find out what I was missing, and that's what it came up with, but it also might be differences in ghc versions I stumbled into. I'll give it a try with 7.6.3. I'm using Trusty 14.04.4 for the project this is for.
