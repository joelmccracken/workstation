I checked and there was no justification given for the use of date rather
than {now} ... Perhaps it predated that?

The only difference between the two is the use of date for some reason
included nanaosecond precision. Otherwise the format is the same.

I have no objection to making that change, but I think it needs to be done
in a separate commit, rather than in passing.

Also, I think `UseUmask Int` could be `UseUmask FileMode`. At least
FileMode is used in some other parts of propellor that deal with umasks.
