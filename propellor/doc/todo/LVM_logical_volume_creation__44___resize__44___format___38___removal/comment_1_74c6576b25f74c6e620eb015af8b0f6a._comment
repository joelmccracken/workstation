That's a pretty nice job for your first haskell code! And an impressive
module.

Most of my review comments have to do with improving types.. Which is
always a nice way to improve already good code. :)

* VolumeGroup and LogicalVolume seem like easy things to mix up.
  Also, there's never a LogicalVolume without an associated VolumeGroup.
  So, suggest `newtype VolumeGroup = VolumeGroup String` and
  `data LogicalVolume = LogicalVolume String VolumeGroup` -- then
  the user would write something like 
  `LogicalVolume "test" (VolumeGroup "vg0")`
* Why not make `LvState` contain a `Maybe Partition.Fs` rather than
  the string value. (This also would move the parsing of filesystem names
  from `fsMatch` to `lvState` or perhaps to another function it uses.)
* It seems a bit wrong for `parseSize` to include the rounding
  to the next extent, which is not really related to parsing.
  Would be better to split those two things into separate functions.

I feel that this module is fairly close to mergeable.
