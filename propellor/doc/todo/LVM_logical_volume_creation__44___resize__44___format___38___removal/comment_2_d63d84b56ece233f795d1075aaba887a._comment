Thanks for your comments.

I also have a problem when running vgs/lvs, they complain about leaked file descriptors. Is it something I can fix?

    File descriptor 10 (/usr/local/propellor/.lock) leaked on vgs invocation. Parent PID 31216: ./dist/build/propellor-config/p
    File descriptor 11 (pipe:[282601]) leaked on vgs invocation. Parent PID 31216: ./dist/build/propellor-config/p
    File descriptor 12 (pipe:[282601]) leaked on vgs invocation. Parent PID 31216: ./dist/build/propellor-config/p
    File descriptor 13 (pipe:[282602]) leaked on vgs invocation. Parent PID 31216: ./dist/build/propellor-config/p
    File descriptor 14 (pipe:[282602]) leaked on vgs invocation. Parent PID 31216: ./dist/build/propellor-config/p

I have pushed a new version with the suggested fixes.
