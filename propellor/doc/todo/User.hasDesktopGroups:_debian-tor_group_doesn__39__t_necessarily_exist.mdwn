The new `User.hasDesktopGroups` tries to add a user to the group `debian-tor` which fails if this group does not exist.

What package creates this group?  If someone could let me know that, I will patch `User.hasDesktopGroups` to only try to add a user to `debian-tor` if `Apt.isInstalled "blah"` is true.

Or perhaps Joey added this group because this group exists by default on Debian Unstable.  If so then a check can be inserted for that.
