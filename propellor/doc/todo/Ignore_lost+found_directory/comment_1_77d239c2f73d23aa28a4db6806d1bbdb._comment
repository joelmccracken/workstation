I feel that modifying `dirCruft` to include "lost+found" is a layering
violation, because it could change the behavior of a lot of things besides
checking if a directory is empty "enough". Consider code that recurses
through a directory and sets permissions or owner.

This calls for a new function, or a modification to a more specific
function, to handle the "lost+found" case.
`Propellor.Property.Chroot.Util.unpopulated` seems like a good place to
handle it.

There are also some backup/restore properties, for Borg and Restic etc, that
only do a restore if a directory is empty or missing, and it seems to make
sense for them to also special-case handling of "lost+found". So it would
make sense to move `unpopulated` to a module that's not chroot-specific
and make those things also use it.
