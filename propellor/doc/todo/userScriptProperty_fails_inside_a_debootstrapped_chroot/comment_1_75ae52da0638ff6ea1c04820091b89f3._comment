This is due to `Debootstrap.built'` removing world read access from the
chroot it creates.

So, /tmp/sid/ is not accessible by spwhitton, and when su
has switched id to spwhitton, it can't access anything inside the chroot.

See commit f6afeb889f4b11418daac7825c1adb1df4ff145c for when this was
added. I think that the risk of farming old security vulnerabilities from
chroots is real, but this is not a good approach for a fix.

(It would work to put the chroot in a parent
directory that is itself not world readable, then the root directory inside the
chroot would be world readable. But this would require relocating existing
chroots. At least when chroots are used for systemd containers,
/var/lib/container has appropriately locked down permissions anyway.)

I'm reverting that commit, and adding some permissions fixup code.
