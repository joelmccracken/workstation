Running propellor that way would probably need ssh to allocate a tty in order for sudo's password prompt to work. And it adds complexity. Does it add security? I don't think so, PermitRootLogin=without-password or PasswordAuthentication=no is not going to let anyone brute force the root account.

PermitRootLogin=forced-commands-only might be worth making easy to set up, so the only command that can be run with some special propellor-specific ssh key is propellor.
