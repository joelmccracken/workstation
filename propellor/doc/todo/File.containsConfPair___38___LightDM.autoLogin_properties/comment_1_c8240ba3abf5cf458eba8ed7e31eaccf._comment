Thanks for submitting these patches!

Looking at `containsConfPair`, it assumes an ini-style file,
so is a little misplaced in Property.File. which is otherwise about generic
text files.

So, it would probably make sense to move it to a new Property.IniFile
module.

However, [[forum/parsing_a_config_file]] recently pointed out that
the tor config file has a similar need. It's not ini format, but
shares the same basic idea of a "section" line which is followed by 
lines setting things specific to that section.

So, it would be great if `containsConfPair` could be generalized to also
cover that tor config file use case. I think this would be pretty easy;
just make it take one string containing the whole section line (including
square brackets for ini file, or whatever for tor config file), and a
second string containing the whole setting line.
