Propellor currently needs a central git server. And it has a special-cased
protocol during bootstrap that transfers the git repo over to a new host,
using the ssh connection that will be used to run propellor.

This could be improved by making a git push be done whenever
`propellor spin $host` runs. The remote propellor runs `git receive-pack`;
the local one runs `git send-pack`.

Then there would be no need for a central git repo. Although still very
useful if you have multiple propellor driven hosts and you want to just git
commit and let cron sort them out.
