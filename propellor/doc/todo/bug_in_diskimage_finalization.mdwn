DiskImage.imageBuilt has broken and no longer runs the finalization
properties that get added to the chroot. This includes installing grub, and
Chroot.noServices etc.

Seems that the `_chroot` info that gets propigated from imageBuilt is
for the chroot before those properties are added to it. Then when chaining
into the chroot, `_chroot` info is examined to find the properties to
ensure.

I have not yet been able to determine what broke it -- I'm sure it used to
work. --[[Joey]]
