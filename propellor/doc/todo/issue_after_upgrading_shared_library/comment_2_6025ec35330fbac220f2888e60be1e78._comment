So I thought of two approaches.

1. Propellor could copy in all the shared libraries. It already contains
   code to do this. But, this would add overhead to every build. And it
   might not guard against all snafus.

2. Make propellor --check that should exit 0. Make --spin check that
   propellor works and rebuild if not. Also make the runPropellor cron job
   do that.

I've gone with option #2.
