I think I saw this once myself (have no servers older than jessie left
now).

I believe the problem can be worked around by running make clean
in /usr/local/propellor on the server.

I'm not clear yet on a good way for --spin to detect that propellor
has failed due to this, rather than some other problem, and try
a clean and rebuild.

Hmm, xmonad should have a similar problem, since it builds a haskell
program locally. I wonder how the debian package deals with it there.

Note there's a libffi6, so this will presumably happen again..
