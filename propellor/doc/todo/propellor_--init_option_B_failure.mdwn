With 3.0.1, 3.0.2 or 3.0.3:

    artemis ~ % propellor --init

    Propellor's configuration file is ~/.propellor/config.hs
    
    Let's get you started with a simple config that you can adapt
    to your needs. You can start with:
       A: A clone of propellor's git repository    (most flexible)
       B: The bare minimum files to use propellor  (most simple)
    Which would you prefer? [A|B] B
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/swhitton/.propellor/.git/
    Creating minimal config ... done
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Let's try building the propellor configuration, to make sure it will work...
    
    Writing a default package environment file to
    /home/swhitton/.propellor/cabal.sandbox.config
    Creating a new sandbox at /home/swhitton/.propellor/.cabal-sandbox
    Resolving dependencies...
    Configuring config-0...
    cabal: At least the following dependencies are missing:
    propellor >=3.0
    propellor: failed to make dist/setup-config

(propellor installed from Debian)
