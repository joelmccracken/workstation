I think this would be great. Patches accepted.

If I were going to implement this, I'd use
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-route53>
to write the propellor Property.

A question is, what host would the Property be attached to?
One way to do it would be to make the property be called something like
`route53Controller`. So then you pick a host, or hosts, and give them this
property for a domain, and those hosts then take care of making the
necessary API calls to route53. Presumably some API keys will be needed
on those hosts, which can be provided via the privdata.

I'm happy to offer advice on implementation, but don't plan to code this up
myself, as I'm happily self-hosting my DNS servers.
