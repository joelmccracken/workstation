Doesn't rebuilding propellor overwrite lots of files too? Is the
privdata.local file somehow a particular problem, perhaps becuase
of its permissions?

You should find it easy enough to make propellor read any existing
file and only update the file when there are changes. But it seems to me
your integrity checker would still go off whenever a new version
of the file is legitimately reveiced. Perhaps it would be better to
write a property to configure your integrity checker to not fire on
this file?

(I've thought from time to time about having rsync update the privdata.local
file. Since it's unchanged in most spins, that would probably save network
bandwidth.)
