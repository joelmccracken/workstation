The types here don't tell me much about what values it expects.

`selectedFor :: String -> [String] -> Property NoInfo`

Function needs either some examples in its haddock, or better types.

Also, the `available` property incorrectly succeeds if the locale passed to
it is not listed in locale.gen.

(It would be nice for these properties to be revertable but that's just a
thought.)
