I avoid those warnings with properties that clone dotfiles repos containing
.gitconfig for root and users who can sudo.

It would be fine to have a property to configure them in
/etckeeper/.git/config, if you wanted to write it.
I think this would do it:

	Git.repoConfigured "/etc/" ("user.name", "whatever")
	Git.repoConfigured "/etc/" ("user.email", "whatever@whatever")

Those would only be used when the user running etckeeper has not configured
it in their own ~/.gitconfig
