Ok, I got --spin to not use the Makefile any more. So with the 2.2.0
release, if you want to make ~/.propellor contain only a config.hs
file and a foo.cabal file, that will work. The cabal file would contain
something like:

<pre>
Executable propellor-config
  Main-Is: config.hs
  GHC-Options: -Wall -threaded -O0
  Build-Depends: propellor, base >= 4.5, base < 5
</pre>
