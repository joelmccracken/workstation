#+TITLE: Joel's Workstation

Having recently taken the time to learn nix, I have decided it is time to revisit my workstation.

* Instructions
1. clone this repo into ~/workstation (does it have to be that location?)
2. cd ~/workstation and run the ~link.sh~ script
3. run the ~set-machine.sh~ with the name of this machine (which links this machine settings).
3. run ~bootstrap-nix.sh~
