#+TITLE: Joel's Workstation

Having recently taken the time to learn nix, I have decided it is time to revisit my workstation.

There were several issues I wanted to address.
(what are they?)
weirdness with
* TODO
- port the run test script
- (should I have a "real" dotfiles project that only has e.g. .bashrc, separate from this project?)
* Instructions
1. clone this repo into ~~/workstation~ (does it have to be that location?)
2. cd ~~/workstation~ and run the link script
3. run the ~set-machine.sh~ with the name of this machine (which links this machine settings).
3. run ~bootstrap-nix.sh~
